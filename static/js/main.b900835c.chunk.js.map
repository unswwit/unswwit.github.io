I was introduced to it as part of the Co-op program and\r\n              just went with it since I didn't know what to do. Mind you I\r\n              definitely struggled in my first year of studying tech, I\r\n              definitely thought I was the odd one out, was struggling to\r\n              understand basic concepts of SQL and was prepared to quit and\r\n              leave it all behind. I definitely think the turning point was\r\n              meeting Blair, who gave me a personalised presentation slides of\r\n              why I/women should stay in tech and the Info systems support\r\n              circle that really opened my eyes about the opportunities in\r\n              tech. I definitely would not have lasted my first year of uni\r\n              without any of them. Once you enter the industry you realise how\r\n              many awesome opportunities there are, and that there is\r\n              definitely a role for everyone regardless what background you\r\n              come from.

I started off a planning and research\r\n              analyst at the Reserve Bank of Australia, before trying out the\r\n              Cyber security space in IAG. I then interned at PwC's Experience\r\n              and Insights Team and gave a shot at strategy consulting at\r\n              Deloitte's S&I team. I am now a senior consultant in PwC's\r\n              Technology Consulting team, specifically in the SuccessFactors\r\n              team.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Absolutely no idea!

I am\r\n              always learning regardless where I end up, so I try not to aim\r\n              for a \"final destination\", rather I think about what other areas\r\n              I can learn from. I definitely do want to move to another\r\n              country just to understand how the tech industry is like in\r\n              another geographic region.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What do you love about your career now?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I love how I get to try out a variety of roles and work with\r\n              different industries.

Born in Germany to\r\n              parents in the US Air Force, she moved frequently, living in many\r\n              US states. While computers were primitive and novel during the\r\n              1980s, Erica had access to them earlier than most kids. Her mum\r\n              created combat plans for the Air Force on a computer in their\r\n              home, which Erica got to play on. In fifth grade, her teacher\r\n              selected her to go to a training for the precursor to the World\r\n              Wide Web and she was hooked. In an{\" \"}\r\n              <a href=\"https://techiesproject.com/erica-baker/\">\r\n                interview she had with Techies Project\r\n              </a>\r\n              , Erica recalls thinking, “I love this. I want to do this.” From\r\n              that moment on, Erica delved into the world of technology,\r\n              learning how to install programs, hack, and write code. Naturally,\r\n              she decided to study computer science at university. But attending\r\n              the University of Miami was not what she expected and she didn’t\r\n              like it. She was one of the only women and one of the only black\r\n              students. She felt like an outsider that wasn’t accepted, so she\r\n              transferred to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where she\r\n              earned an associate’s degree in what we would refer to today as\r\n              information technology. From there, she launched her career at the\r\n              university.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Erica’s experience at the University of Miami was the first of\r\n              many uncomfortable experiences she would have as a black woman\r\n              working in tech. Whilst working at Google a decade after\r\n              graduation, she recalls that the CEO mistook her as an assistant\r\n              instead of an engineer. When the CEO discovered she was an\r\n              engineer, he wanted to work with a male instead, and advised her\r\n              to hang a door sign that explained her role, unlike any other\r\n              engineers. The situation was not unique, and Erica grew frustrated\r\n              that her colleagues did not see her as capable as her white, male\r\n              counterparts. She came to realize that there were some workplace\r\n              cultures where she would not be able to succeed, no matter how\r\n              hard she was willing to work. This inspired her to advocate that\r\n              companies should not only hire but retain minority employees. It\r\n              also sparked her idea to create an internal spreadsheet where\r\n              Google employees reported their salary data to better understand\r\n              pay disparities within the company.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>Career Success</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              In addition to Google, Erica has worked for other well known\r\n              companies in Silicon Valley including GitHub, Slack, Patreon, and\r\n              Microsoft. She’s come a long way since she began her career\r\n              working in tech support for her university!

In a 2016 interview with Techies Project, Erica said,\r\n              “Right now I get to have this voice—people listen to me for some\r\n              reason, and I have support at work to continue speaking about\r\n              these things; and permission to say whatever I feel from the CEO\r\n              of my company—which is super rare, Not everybody gets that. And\r\n              it’s a huge privilege, and so I’m not going to waste that\r\n              privilege. I want to use it to speak up so that we can make\r\n              improvements. I think the first step is talking about what’s going\r\n              on and then getting uncomfortable...

My favorite subject though\r\n              was English. In university I was exposed to various aspects of\r\n              computer science ranging from programming, operating systems,\r\n              matlab, embedded systems etc. I got interested in the web\r\n              programming side of it and that led me to study Masters in\r\n              Information Technology in UNSW. There I enjoyed the subjects on\r\n              web application development(ecommerce, database).\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I started as a graduate engineer in Solentive. There I gained\r\n              hands on experience in working with C# .Net, Javascript, SQL and\r\n              other web technologies. I applied the concepts of Java learnt in\r\n              university there. I really liked working with Javascript and\r\n              applied to Channel Nine. I was hired in a creative wing where I\r\n              worked on front end campaigns for partner companies. At that time\r\n              React and Node were new and I wanted to work in that space, which\r\n              led me to changing teams and to my current team Nine Digital.

Soon\r\n              after, she joined her first amateur astronomical society. Her love\r\n              for astronomy, which she describes as “ridiculous” guided her\r\n              educational pursuits. By age 26, she had already earned a Ph.D. in\r\n              Radio Astronomy. Her work on the SKA Pathfinder telescope led to\r\n              the discovery of tens of millions of new galaxies. And if solving\r\n              the mysteries of the universe isn’t enough, in 2018, she was\r\n              appointed the Australian Government Ambassador for Women in STEM.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Dr. Harvey shares astronomical concepts with women in ways that\r\n              are interesting and accessible. She explains her reason for being\r\n              a science communicator and educator instead of a traditional\r\n              teacher is because: “I wanted to use my creativity rather than\r\n              teach in a confined setting – that’s what I love about science\r\n              communication, the creative aspect. The challenge of breaking out\r\n              of my science niche and cutting through the jargon and explaining\r\n              these cool concepts. I find it challenging and engaging and I love\r\n              watching people’s faces as the penny drops.”\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              If Dr. Harvey had to be described in one word, it would be\r\n              ambitious. When she’s not conducting astronomical research and\r\n              sharing her love of astronomy with others, she’s advocating for\r\n              women in the workplace. In her 10-year plan for Women in STEM, she\r\n              urges the need to accelerate the pace of change in reducing the\r\n              gender pay gap for women. In her address to the National Press\r\n              Club in 2019, she warned that it will take more than 200 years to\r\n              close the gap at the current rate of progress. Her research on\r\n              unconscious bias in the workplace and her advocacy has already led\r\n              to improvements in the hiring process. Companies are now removing\r\n              gendered pronouns in applications so that more women will receive\r\n              research grants and job opportunities.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Currently, women make up only 17% of the STEM qualified population\r\n              in Australia. Professor Harvey Smith advises that it is the\r\n              responsibility of students, educators, parents, and businesses to\r\n              encourage, promote, and raise awareness for all women in STEM. As\r\n              an author for young children, her wish is for young girls to see\r\n              smart and empowering female leaders involved in science and\r\n              technology and feel a part of the STEM community. She urges,\r\n              “Instead of asking girls what the colour of the flower is, ask how\r\n              many flowers there are.” By encouraging young females to think\r\n              mathematically and scientifically, she believes more females will\r\n              seek careers in STEM and gender equity will become the norm.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Professor Lisa Harvey Smith shows us that successful females not\r\n              only have love, determination and exploration for their own\r\n              fields, but they also make time to encourage women in STEM.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Professor Lisa Harvey Smith is currently the Professor of Practice\r\n              at UNSW.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"elisa-sanjurjo\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/elisa.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Elisa Sanjurjo\",\r\n              \"Education Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n            \"victoria-ruming\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/victoria.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Victoria Ruming\",\r\n              \"Education Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost2;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost20 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.png\" title=\"Blog Post #20\" />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\r\n              Introducing : Aneita Yang, Product Manager At Atlassian\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p className={styles.date}>2nd September 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Aneita Yang is product manager of Bitbucket Cloud at Atlassian, a\r\n              program that allows teams to manage workflow from design to\r\n              implementation as well as edit and deploy the code these teams are\r\n              working on.

STEM related industries are responsible for designing\r\n              many things that each of us use in our day to day lives which\r\n              affect both females and males. Did you know that when Siri first\r\n              came out it was 70% more accurate when recognising a males voice\r\n              than a females, and that female car crash dummies only started\r\n              being tested in this decade? If females are not in the room then\r\n              decisions are made without a female perspective, and that affects\r\n              the female customer base. In the case of the car crash dummies,\r\n              that's a matter of female safety. It's the same for all different\r\n              types of diversity. A Harvard study suggests that there needs to\r\n              be at least 3 in 10 of a minority group in the room to impact a\r\n              decision being made and according to Engineers Australia 84% of\r\n              Australian engineering graduates are men, so there is still so\r\n              much work to do to get females into STEM related careers.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              As I'm early on in my career I am constantly learning. Being ok\r\n              with not knowing everything all at once or straight away is ok but\r\n              is something that I am sometimes challenged by.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your\r\n              career?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I have been inspired by a range of different people throughout my\r\n              career so far.

I take inspiration from those who demonstrate\r\n              leadership, are passionate about what they do, and have a strong\r\n              commitment to social and environmental ethics.

The\r\n              hard skills will come through your degree without really any\r\n              further work. Coming into the workforce in a STEM career you are\r\n              hired for your potential and problem solving capability which you\r\n              would have gained through a STEM related degree. The soft skills\r\n              are often what you are assessed on throughout graduate recruitment\r\n              processes - typical questions in a graduate interview for a STEM\r\n              related graduate role will relate to how you work in a team, how\r\n              you have managed difficult conversations such as when someone\r\n              didn't agree with you or how you manage your time. Such skills can\r\n              be built up by casual work through your time at university (that\r\n              doesn't need to be STEM related), plus getting involved in\r\n              volunteering initiatives, university societies and other\r\n              extracurricular activities.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What is one piece of advice that you would give to your younger\r\n              self back in university?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Work hard but make time for yourself - hobbies, a casual job,\r\n              spending time with family and friends.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>Favourite Quote or Motto?</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Always make time for yourself, no matter how busy you are.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"vivian-wong\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/vivw.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\r\n              \"Education Executive\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost21;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost22 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.png\" title=\"Blog Post #22\" />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\r\n              4 Ways Technology is Changing how we make Art\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p className={styles.date}>13th September 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Technology is not all about maths and science.

His work\r\n                is multilayered, inspired by Gothic and Islamic architectural\r\n                elements.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <div className={styles.outerBox}>\r\n                <div className={styles.innerBox}>\r\n                  <img\r\n                    src={\r\n                      process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\r\n                      \"/blog-attachments/blog-22-fashion-5.jpg\"\r\n                    }\r\n                    alt=\"Either/Or Newmarch\"\r\n                  />\r\n                  <a className={styles.sourceLink} href=\"http://www.eric-standley.com/#/eitheror-newmarch/\">\r\n                    http://www.eric-standley.com/#/eitheror-newmarch/\r\n                  </a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <div className={styles.innerBox}>\r\n                  <img\r\n                    src={\r\n                      process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\r\n                      \"/blog-attachments/blog-22-fashion-6.jpg\"\r\n                    }\r\n                    alt=\"Either/Or Newmarch\"\r\n                  />\r\n                  <a className={styles.sourceLink} href=\"http://www.eric-standley.com/#/eitheror-newmarch/\">\r\n                    http://www.eric-standley.com/#/eitheror-newmarch/\r\n                  </a>\r\n                </div>                 \r\n              </div>            \r\n              <br />\r\n              \r\n\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                Laser-cutters may also be used to create artwork out of wood.\r\n                Oakland-based artist Gabriel Schama uses such a technique to\r\n                create faces, patterns and religious icons out of laser-cut wood\r\n                layers.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <div className={styles.pic}>\r\n                <img\r\n                  src={\r\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\r\n                    \"/blog-attachments/blog-22-fashion-7.jpg\"\r\n                  }\r\n                  alt=\"Either/Or Newmarch\"\r\n                />\r\n                <a className={styles.sourceLink} href=\"https://www.gabrielschama.com/2016lasercuts/2015/8/16/3ypxfq4rz6nd2mge4h27o2ohkpx480\">\r\n                  https://www.gabrielschama.com/2016lasercuts/2015/8/16/3ypxfq4rz6nd2mge4h27o2ohkpx480\r\n                </a>               \r\n              </div>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <li className={styles.question}>Code-Generated Art</li>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                Art is often structured, geometric or otherwise mathematical in\r\n                some form.

During her training at UNSW, she\r\n              volunteered her time to share her technical know-how with fellow\r\n              students and children through Code Create, Tutorial Demonstrator,\r\n              and Code Like a Girl.

In my first semester of\r\n              uni I (somewhat luckily) found myself in an introduction to\r\n              programming course which piqued my interest in the field and set\r\n              me on the path toward software engineering!\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              In my first year studying software engineering, I started tutoring\r\n              at UNSW and tutored several subjects throughout my studies.\r\n              Outside of uni I also volunteered with organisations like Code\r\n              Like a Girl. During university I had two consecutive internships\r\n              at Google - the first in Sydney and the second in California.

Before this book, I would drink an average of\r\n              two cups of coffee a day and sleep around 7 hours per night. I led\r\n              a very active lifestyle and thought that I was pretty on top of my\r\n              health. What I did not understand was the vast implications of\r\n              cutting down hours of sleep and how it impacted not only my\r\n              neurological health but every other facet of my general health.\r\n              Whilst there is a long list of benefits or lack thereof when you\r\n              sleep for less than 8 hours, I want to share a secret I learned\r\n              about the best study hack to ace your exams, and the answer is\r\n              SLEEP.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              When we sleep, we go through two distinct phases, the first being\r\n              REM (Rapid-Eye-Movement) Sleep and NREM (Non-Rapid-Eye-Movement)\r\n              Sleep. REM sleep fuels creativity. It is a time for our brain to\r\n              connect past experiences and emotions to build a more accurate\r\n              representation of how our world works. We often hear people say\r\n              that they need to \"sleep on it\" when contemplating big decisions,\r\n              or have you ever woken up and the answer to your problems is now\r\n              at the centre of your mind. Research shows that this problem\r\n              solving, and creative control arises from REM sleep.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              However, memory consolidation occurs during NREM. In this phase,\r\n              all the thoughts, ideas, and pieces of information we have stored\r\n              in our short-term memory (stored in a region of the brain called\r\n              the hippocampus) are transferred and consolidated to the Cortex.\r\n              Critically, recalling information from long term memory can only\r\n              occur if we have fallen asleep. Interestingly, Walker uses the\r\n              metaphor of sleep, acting as a computer hard drive recovery\r\n              service salvaging presumably deleted memory files. For instance,\r\n              facts that we have forgotten soon after learning, such as a name\r\n              or order of operations are recalled easily upon waking from a good\r\n              night of sleep, leading to the lightbulb moment.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Additionally, Dr Robert Stickgold, a researcher at Harvard Medical\r\n              School, conducted a study in which students had to learn a visual\r\n              memory task through repetition. One group of participants received\r\n              a good night of sleep (8+ hours) on the day of learning and then\r\n              tested three days later. They had good memory recall. Another\r\n              group received a poor night of sleep (less than 8 hours) after\r\n              learning and were tested three days later (the other nights having\r\n              sufficient hours of sleep). This group failed to perform the\r\n              memory task. Thus, Dr Stickgold’s research concluded that it is\r\n              imperative to receive a good night of sleep after learning for\r\n              memory consolidation. It does not matter if you catch up on sleep\r\n              the days after. Memory consolidation is an all or nothing event.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              To sleep 8+ hours the night before a big study day is proven to be\r\n              incredibly efficient.

However, finding events and workshops\r\n              around campus was difficult and scattered over multiple mediums\r\n              (UNSW website, Eventbrite, Facebook), and I wondered why there\r\n              wasn’t an easier way to navigate events on campus.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How did LinkUp become affiliated with Arc?

They loved how we were making it easier for\r\n              students to be involved with uni life and offered their support.\r\n              It was a great experience working with them.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Who was on the founding team and what roles did you have\r\n              allocated? After the project took off, were more people recruited\r\n              to join the team?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              D: LinkUp started off with me, Zhou and Felicia. I worked mainly\r\n              on the frontend of the website while Zhou worked on backend and\r\n              devops. Felicia was in charge of marketing. After a period of\r\n              growth, yes, we did decide to recruit more members to help LinkUp\r\n              become an even better product.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Can you tell us about the process of building LinkUp? What time\r\n              commitments did it require?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Z: Building LinkUp took a long time. The whole process involved\r\n              splitting the project into iterations so it was easier to handle,\r\n              and focused on building MVPs so we could iteratively improve them\r\n              later on. We experimented with code and features and researched\r\n              methods and solutions to our problem, which we defined earlier:\r\n              finding events. We also talked a lot with each other before making\r\n              decisions. A small part of the project was Googling and using\r\n              Stack Overflow to find tutorials and code examples that we could\r\n              use since we were relatively new to personal projects. In terms of\r\n              time commitment, the project was very flexible and fit within our\r\n              schedules. Some weeks we might have spent a few hours on it, and\r\n              others felt like a full-time job (often when we had nothing else\r\n              to do e.g,. summer holidays). We’ve probably spent well over a few\r\n              hundred hours so far on LinkUp.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              F: In terms of building our user base and reaching students, we\r\n              focused on Facebook discussion groups as the easiest way to reach\r\n              a large number of students.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What did you learn whilst creating LinkUp?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              D: LinkUp consists of a small and dedicated team, so I learned how\r\n              to work in a team and the importance of communication and time\r\n              management to deploy features on time. I also learned to work with\r\n              external parties to satisfy both Linkup’s needs and theirs.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Z: I learned how to use AWS to host our website, CDN and backend,\r\n              how to write scripts to scrape websites using Python and set up\r\n              continuous delivery for our repo. I also learned a bit of React so\r\n              I could help out with the frontend.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              F: I have definitely developed my teamwork and communication\r\n              skills along the way, but I also realised how lucky we are at UNSW\r\n              to have such an active and engaged student community. Society\r\n              events are a huge part of the uni experience at UNSW, in\r\n              comparison to other universities, and I’m really grateful for\r\n              that. It would be amazing if LinkUp could help shape student\r\n              communities in other unis as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are some of the challenges you faced while creating LinkUp?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Z: Probably encountering a bug or error and not being able to find\r\n              a fix on Google. The best thing to do here is to take a break and\r\n              refresh your mind for a while, so when you come back, you can take\r\n              a different approach. Another challenge was finding the motivation\r\n              to do the project. This might be different for everyone, but I\r\n              found setting goals and thinking about the future helped me be\r\n              more motivated in creating LinkUp.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Who did you turn to for help along the way?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Z: Whenever we needed help, we would either Google it, ask our\r\n              teammates for help, or ask questions in relevant coding\r\n              communities available to us. Some supportive communities for\r\n              asking coding related questions are CSESoc workshops, Pcsoc\r\n              discord, r/learn programming, and other programming subreddits, a\r\n              certain UNSW society discord, and plenty of others.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              F: We also have talked to a wonderful mentor from UNSW Founders,\r\n              who helped guide us and focus on our goals.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What has been the most rewarding part of creating LinkUp?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              D: Seeing students using LinkUp and receiving feedback about how\r\n              much it has helped them find events around campus will continue to\r\n              be the most rewarding part of Linkup. Knowing that other people\r\n              are also finding value in a project that you spent so much time\r\n              and effort on will serve as a motivation to improve LinkUp\r\n              continually.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Z: While creating LinkUp, I realised how rewarding a personal\r\n              project can be and how much you can learn from the experience.\r\n              Personal projects are completely different from course projects\r\n              regarding how much control you have over your project. You get to\r\n              choose your own teammates without any restrictions, have a\r\n              flexible time commitment that fits in with your schedule, do\r\n              something you are interested in, plus so many other things.\r\n              Ultimately, this made it easier to learn the technologies required\r\n              to build LinkUp and learn what we were interested in. I highly\r\n              encourage everyone interested in software engineering to start a\r\n              personal project for something that interests them. There is just\r\n              so much you can learn from it.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              F: Like Deki, for me, it’s knowing students are using the site and\r\n              that we’re actually helping strengthen UNSW’s student community.\r\n              Every time a student or society contacts us with questions or\r\n              support, it’s super exciting and makes me want to do more.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What has been the initial impact of LinkUp?

We can’t say much\r\n              yet, but you can expect ways to give feedback for an event and a\r\n              voting system. We will still maintain it after graduation,\r\n              depending on how much time we have, but don’t expect any major\r\n              updates. This should be fine, though, as it doesn’t require much\r\n              time to maintain.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What advice would you give to other students who want to pursue a\r\n              personal project?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              D: If you have a personal project you are interested in, then I\r\n              would say just start it. If you need help learning the frameworks\r\n              or languages, there are so many great resources with my personal\r\n              favourite being Youtube and Codecademy.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Z: Do something you’re interested in, go to relevant workshops,\r\n              use your support (founders, CSESOC, WIT, etc,) and have fun.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              F: Think about what you want to achieve and why, write down your\r\n              goals, and celebrate every victory.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Deki, Zhou, and Felicia have built something that makes every\r\n              student’s life easier and more enriching at UNSW. Not many people\r\n              leave that sort of legacy! Along the way, they developed their\r\n              technical skills, overcome technical challenges, and explored\r\n              their interests. And of course, this project showcases their\r\n              skills in a unique way that will surely be attractive to many\r\n              employers. On behalf of all UNSW students, thank you Deki, Zhou,\r\n              and Felicia for volunteering your time to build something we love\r\n              so much!

During my Bachelor's degree, I have contributed immensely\r\n              to the UNSW student community in the role of Peer mentor and\r\n              Petroleum Engineering Student Ambassador, and consequently, was\r\n              awarded the 'Engineering Student Service Award'. Since then, I am\r\n              pursuing doctoral studies at UNSW School of Minerals and Energy\r\n              Resources Engineering with a focus on image analysis, data\r\n              science, and rocks. To keep myself updated with the energy\r\n              industry, I have also had internships at Woodside Energy in Perth.\r\n              Finally, I look forward to finishing my doctoral studies in 2020\r\n              and be more involved with the energy industry to contribute to a\r\n              greener and cleaner future.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I really believe that the more exposure one has to real-world\r\n              problems, the better one can contribute to the community and think\r\n              out-of-box. As I finish my doctoral studies, I aim to get a\r\n              360-degree experience in petroleum, mining, renewable, and data\r\n              science industries. The need to gain experience in this\r\n              quadra-combo will guide my future career roles in the short to\r\n              medium term.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>What do you love about your career now?</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I absolutely love that I learn something new every day. As a\r\n              doctoral student, you learn to never give up and tackle the same\r\n              problem in so many different ways that it will amaze you how\r\n              thinking differently and collaborating can lead to great\r\n              innovations. Looking at my career in a broader sense, being a part\r\n              of such a diverse energy and resources industry, thrills me every\r\n              day because there is a vision that I can live up to and that is to\r\n              be able to bring electricity to those households who are currently\r\n              deprived of such luxuries.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              In the last few years, we have all witnessed that technology has\r\n              developed and progressed at a lightning speed. From a business\r\n              perspective, implementing some of these outstanding technologies\r\n              has been challenging in the mining and petroleum industry. This is\r\n              even the case when we know that we need it to keep the costs low\r\n              and be more efficient. Therefore, I think being able to use\r\n              state-of-the-art data science and cloud computing technologies to\r\n              bring in the value to the companies is a big challenge. More so,\r\n              there are multiple avenues to improve performance and address\r\n              issues such as climate change and human rights policies that help\r\n              the energy companies operate in harmony with everyone.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your\r\n              career?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              My family is my biggest inspiration.

HackerRank is\r\n                great because it provides verified solutions in multiple\r\n                languages and tagged topics and difficulty levels.

Today, we're going to\r\n                go over the most common structure of technical interviews for a{\" \"}\r\n                <strong>software engineering role</strong>.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                The typical interview is ~45 minutes long. We begin with\r\n                self-introductions for the first ~5 minutes. Here's your\r\n                opportunity to tell the interviewer a little bit about yourself,\r\n                your motivations for applying to this role and what experiences\r\n                you have (from other internships, hackathon, personal projects\r\n                etc). Next we would spend the next 30-35 minutes answering\r\n                technical questions and wrap-up with ~5 minutes of questions you\r\n                would like to ask the interviewer.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                For the technical questions, you should expect to be given\r\n                either 1 hard question or 2 easy-medium questions for you to\r\n                CODE up in the 30-35 minutes. Following this, you will always be\r\n                asked about the time and space complexity of your code. You\r\n                should always begin by understanding the question asked. Spend\r\n                the next 2-3 minutes asking any clarifying questions (addressing\r\n                input/output types, asking how it might handle certain edge\r\n                cases) and think of test cases and confirming their intended\r\n                output. Then, you can think about your code implementation and\r\n                verbalize how you intend to implement the code. After the\r\n                interviewer has given you the 'green light' you should begin by\r\n                choosing your coding language and start coding it up.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                A: I’ve only done 1 technical interview and it was actually 55\r\n                minutes and one part of a three hour session. There was a brief\r\n                introduction (there was only one interviewer) and then we jumped\r\n                into the problem-solving and ended off with around 5 minutes of\r\n                questions for the interviewer too. Most people answer 2 - 3\r\n                questions (easy-medium difficulty). The platform used was\r\n                CodePair which lets you and your interviewer collaboratively\r\n                code. The interview gave one question at a time, I would code,\r\n                test and then be asked ways to optimise my implementation based\r\n                on space and time complexity.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n              <li className={styles.question}>\r\n                How did you test your code in your interviews?\r\n              </li>\r\n              <br />{\" \"}\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                V: For the technical interviews I sat, they were usually done on\r\n                a whiteboard or on CoderPad. Either way, they don't let you\r\n                'run' your code. You can 'test' your code by thinking of edge\r\n                cases and seeing how your code handles it, or how you can adjust\r\n                your code to handle this case.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                A: My technical interview was online/virtual so I could actually\r\n                run my code within the online coding platform but the testing\r\n                process is the same - you would input test cases (consider edge\r\n                cases and error cases if any) and compare the output.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n              <li className={styles.question}>\r\n                What are some of the questions/topics you were asked?\r\n              </li>\r\n              <div className=\"img-box outer-box\">\r\n                <div className=\"inner-box\">\r\n                  <img\r\n                    src={\r\n                      process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\r\n                      \"/blog-attachments/blog-28-topics-1.jpg\"\r\n                    }\r\n                    alt=\"techInterviews-1\"\r\n                    resizeMode=\"contain\"\r\n                  />\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <br />\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                V: Another thing you also want to be familiar with is the\r\n                libraries of your chosen language eg.

This is\r\n                important since it would tell the interviewer how well you know\r\n                the language and it would also make your code <em>pythonic</em>,\r\n                aligning with the Python style guides.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                A: I was told to revise on data structures and algorithms (not\r\n                necessarily the names but how to apply them) before my\r\n                interview.

I sat my Google STEP\r\n                interviews in C and passed, and I know many other UNSW students\r\n                who did the same for their roles and got accepted too.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                A: I’ve been coding with Python for all my coding tests and\r\n                technical interviews. It’s what I’m most comfortable with and\r\n                there’s just some things (e.g. data structures) that are quicker\r\n                and easier to implement in Python than C (even though C was my\r\n                first language). For general software developer interviews, they\r\n                usually choose questions that can be answered in a range of\r\n                languages, so if you only know one language like C, that’s fine\r\n                - it just might take longer to answer. However, if you are\r\n                applying for a role with a specific language (e.g. C#\r\n                Developer), then your coding tests will most likely require you\r\n                to code in that language.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n              <li className={styles.question}>\r\n                How did you communicate your thought process / code\r\n                implementation to the interviewer?\r\n              </li>\r\n              <br />{\" \"}\r\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                V: You want to verbalise your thought process to the interview\r\n                as you code.

You should definitely take\r\n                the chance to practice a couple of mock interviews with friends\r\n                or at society events such as WIT where you can practice\r\n                technical interviews with company representatives.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"psot-content\">\r\n                A: Even with uni exams, I tend to write my plan of attack in\r\n                comments first (e.g. sort through this, loop through this then\r\n                find this). So during the interview, I would also be saying it\r\n                aloud too.

My interviewer was a backend developer\r\n                but I’m more interested in frontend so I asked about how the\r\n                different sides interacted, how tasks are separated/delegated,\r\n                why he chose backend and difference between intern and grad\r\n                application process.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n              <li className={styles.question}>\r\n                Did you ever get a question you didn’t know how to answer?

Redesigning a major company was a huge\r\n              risk and although Yahoo! was later sold to Verizon, Mayer was a\r\n              fundamental key in its future success.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              After her resignation at Yahoo!, Mayer began her own start-up Lumi\r\n              Labs, a business that utilises AI to complete mundane tasks.

Due to the\r\n              decentralized and distributed nature of cryptocurrencies, in\r\n              conjunction with the disablement of government manipulation, they\r\n              foster a deeper level of customer confidence.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>Lendtech</p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Lendtech refers to digital platforms that facilitate a more\r\n              streamlined approach to matching lenders with borrowers. Lendtech\r\n              platforms utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning\r\n              algorithms to verify credentials, match borrowers to lenders, and\r\n              predict a suitable interest rate. The rise of lendtech has created\r\n              a space for borrowers with lower credit ratings to have the\r\n              ability to obtain loans, while more pro-risk lenders have the\r\n              chance to recoup higher returns.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>Paytech</p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              With PayPal, AfterPay, ZipPay, and many others becoming peripheral\r\n              actors in our online shopping regimes, the new digitized way of\r\n              spending has incorporated itself seamlessly into our everyday\r\n              lives. Beneath the surface of a more convenient checkout, Paytech\r\n              integrates its digital platform with expansive networks to create\r\n              more efficient digital connectivity for its customers.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>Mobile Payments</p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Fintech has further facilitated the streamlining of the payment\r\n              process through mobile payments such as Apple Pay, Google Wallet,\r\n              and more. The creation of digital wallets eliminates the barriers\r\n              and inefficiencies associated with traditional means of payment,\r\n              removing the unnecessary resources required for cash payments.\r\n              Furthermore, mobile payments improve customer service by analyzing\r\n              trends in purchase history information, making the relationship\r\n              between the seller and buyer more personalized than ever.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>The Future and Beyond</p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              So what does the rise of fintech mean for us?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              As users, we can now enjoy a more efficient transaction process,\r\n              with real-time payments, easier access to credit, and a higher\r\n              level of service. The banking sector, however, is facing a\r\n              different story. Thousands of new and up and coming fintech\r\n              start-ups are offering products and services that were\r\n              traditionally encompassed by traditional players in the banking\r\n              industry. While there will be losses in some areas, namely routine\r\n              and easily automatable tasks, these will be recouped through a\r\n              culture of innovation and collaboration. With most banks having a\r\n              deep and thorough understanding of financial services, as well as\r\n              generations of consumer trust, fintech companies are centered\r\n              around employees from a background other than finance. Thus, a\r\n              collaborative effort between the up and coming financial\r\n              technology sector and the traditional finance industry will carve\r\n              the future towards a more equitable, and accessible financial\r\n              services industry.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"jane-wang\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/jane-wang.png\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Jane Wang\",\r\n              \"Events Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost32;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost33 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.png\" title=\"Blog Post #33\" />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>WCW ~ ALL WIT Exec Team 2020</h2>\r\n            <p className={styles.date}>21st October 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What sparked your interest to study a STEM degree?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              <strong>Amanda</strong>: I always knew I wanted to have a job that\r\n              had both a creative and analytical/logical side and studying\r\n              software was the perfect combination of the two, being able to\r\n              design and implement products.

WIT gave me the opportunity to write the\r\n              mark scheme and be the moderator for the Hackathon, be the MC of\r\n              events and attend meetings with sponsors, as well as other\r\n              societies.

As an intrinsically competitive\r\n              person, it's so important to remind yourself that we can only\r\n              forge our own futures by competing with the expectations that we\r\n              hold to ourselves, not others - so avoid spiralling down the\r\n              rabbit hole of LinkedIn, you are on your way to where you should\r\n              be.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What was the greatest challenge you faced?

As I slowly transition\r\n              into the workforce, I cannot help but experience the “Imposter\r\n              Syndrome”.

Inevitably,\r\n              even fully qualified graduates like Shadiyah ten years ago, can be\r\n              left without a company that will offer them a place.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Even though I have a few years left at uni, I can’t pretend that I\r\n              haven’t been a little anxious that jobs will still be in short\r\n              supply when I graduate, and that doesn’t even compare to how tough\r\n              it is for the students graduating this year. Despite these\r\n              struggles, Shadiyah turned a difficult situation into new\r\n              opportunities that have led her to the successful career that she\r\n              has today. So even though we might be currently living in a\r\n              pandemic, it’s important to realize that this situation won’t last\r\n              forever.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Her experience is a timely reminder that even when things don’t go\r\n              to plan, there are other pathways to find. If Shadiyah had found a\r\n              job directly after graduating, would she have found herself in\r\n              South Korea, or with a successful career in the tech industry in\r\n              Australia? Likewise, for us, we could discover new pathways that\r\n              lead to something which we couldn’t have imagined otherwise.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>Don’t be afraid to put your hand up.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              <em>\r\n                “Be the person who isn’t afraid to put your hand up.

Hearing about how she moved from a writer to a\r\n              product owner at CBA without a traditional tech background, it’s\r\n              clear that these accomplishments came about by willingly stepping\r\n              up to challenges and going beyond what was expected of her.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              It’s easy to pre-empt failure and shy away from taking on the\r\n              challenges we face. Shadiyah emphasised the need to ask the people\r\n              around her for help when she was stuck, and the continual learning\r\n              she undertook. It’s about looking at challenges with a growth\r\n              mindset, because even when we do fail, we have gained important\r\n              lessons, and these lessons have great power in helping us the next\r\n              time we put our hands up.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              The future is at the intersection of business and technology.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              <em>\r\n                “Technology is ever-changing, so our customers' wants and needs,\r\n                as well as business’s wants and needs… If you can bridge\r\n                technical understanding with business and customer\r\n                understanding, that is gold.”\r\n              </em>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The intersection of business and technology is at the heart of\r\n              what Shadiyah does as an Innovation Advisory Consultant at AWS.\r\n              She believes it is also at the heart of businesses moving\r\n              forwards.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Coming from a more technical background myself, I’ve usually been\r\n              interested in tech for its own sake. This opened my eyes to the\r\n              fact that to a business, its greatest value is in its ability to\r\n              help address its customers’ needs. In that sense, technology\r\n              innovation can’t exist in its own bubble. Businesses and customers\r\n              need to benefit from these innovations, and we can only achieve\r\n              that with an understanding of both tech capabilities and business\r\n              needs.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Recruiters look for someone who can inspire a team.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              <em>\r\n                “When I’m interviewing, I’m always looking for someone who can\r\n                demonstrate they were able to bring clarity to a situation, they\r\n                were able to make the people around them very confident, they\r\n                were able to build trust and attract desire to progress that\r\n                initiative further.”\r\n              </em>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              We were super lucky that Shadiyah could offer a recruiter’s\r\n              perspective on the skills and attributes that she looks for in a\r\n              potential employee. What she said wasn’t quite what I expected to\r\n              hear from a recruiter.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I’ve heard plenty of times that employers are looking for someone\r\n              who takes initiative and is a capable problem solver. However,\r\n              Shadiyah suggests that it takes more than being able to solve\r\n              problems on your own. It’s about being able to inspire others to\r\n              believe in your solutions as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              This is a skill that can be developed by actively participating in\r\n              teamwork, whether that be at uni or outside of it. Following her\r\n              advice from earlier, putting your hand up to more challenges also\r\n              creates more opportunities to solve problems alongside other\r\n              people, and thus, the opportunity to inspire them as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              These lessons all add up to an overarching theme: that anything is\r\n              possible with the right mindset and an openness to learn. Shadiyah\r\n              embodied this attitude, and her energy was completely infectious.\r\n              Particularly in the uncertainty of a global pandemic, this belief\r\n              is more important than ever. With this in mind, the future holds\r\n              opportunities for all of us, as long as we take the initiative to\r\n              find them.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              For more amazing advice and to hear Shadiyah’s journey and more,\r\n              listen to our chat with Shadiyah in her Talk WIT Us episode,\r\n              available in these platforms!\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <div className={[styles.outerBox, styles.smallContainer].join(\" \")}>\r\n              <a\r\n                className={styles.innerBox}\r\n                href=\"https://anchor.fm/unswwit/episodes/Episode-2-Careers-Deep-Dive---Digital-Transformation-w-Shadiyah-Lim-ekak30\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n              >\r\n                <img                \r\n                  src={\r\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\r\n                    \"/blog-attachments/podcast-platforms/anchor-logo.png\"\r\n                  }\r\n                  alt=\"Anchor\"\r\n                />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <a\r\n                className={styles.innerBox}\r\n                href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8zNTQxM2JkMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw/episode/NTIwMDU5N2YtMjg5NC00ZjEwLWE2NTItMWRiMDc4ZGU0Njc5?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwigtazP_szsAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n              >\r\n                <img                 \r\n                  src={\r\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\r\n                    \"/blog-attachments/podcast-platforms/google-podcasts-logo.png\"\r\n                  }\r\n                  alt=\"Google Podcasts\"\r\n                />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <a\r\n                className={styles.innerBox}\r\n                href=\"https://radiopublic.com/talk-wit-us-Ww3A3m/s1!284a5\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n              >\r\n                <img\r\n                  src={\r\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\r\n                    \"/blog-attachments/podcast-platforms/radiopublic-logo.png\"\r\n                  }\r\n                  alt=\"RadioPublic\"\r\n                />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <a\r\n                className={styles.innerBox}\r\n                href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HAs2EMlXumfQzoaGMUpV8?si=isyEiUXwTBCqg5gLDwQiOg\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n              >\r\n                <img\r\n                  src={\r\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\r\n                    \"/blog-attachments/podcast-platforms/spotify-logo.png\"\r\n                  }\r\n                  alt=\"Spotify\"\r\n                />\r\n              </a>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"angenie-bai\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/angenie-bai.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Angenie Bai\",\r\n              \"Externals Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost34;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost35 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.png\" title=\"Blog Post #35\" />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\r\n              Introducing: Calista Kusuma, Information Systems and Marketing\r\n              Student\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p className={styles.date}>28th October 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Calista Kusuma is a Marketing and Information Systems student at\r\n              UNSW, passionate about finding new opportunities to grow and\r\n              making an impact with those opportunities.

But I'd always been\r\n              fascinated by technology, its ever-evolving nature and how it\r\n              disrupts the modern business landscape. This led me to take\r\n              INFS1602 and INFS1603 in first year, which sparked the idea of\r\n              pursuing an information systems degree with commerce. After some\r\n              research, I became increasingly attracted to interesting subjects\r\n              like mobile app development, and the wide career opportunities\r\n              that information systems offered. I also felt it would be a unique\r\n              match with my Marketing major- I wanted variety in my studies, and\r\n              to build a wide range of technical and soft skill sets so that I\r\n              could explore different fields as I figured out what I wanted in a\r\n              career. So, I chose to change to a Commerce and Information\r\n              Systems degree to explore my curiosities in-depth.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The differences between information systems and marketing are\r\n              exactly what has made studying them together so enjoyable - I can\r\n              be coding in one tutorial and researching Adidas' brand strategy\r\n              the next! I've also been able to explore many industries due to\r\n              the diversity and transferability of the skills I've developed.\r\n              I've completed development programs with great firms like\r\n              McKinsey, BCG and Bloomberg, and jobs and projects in areas from\r\n              technology consulting, marketing to even analytical journalism. My\r\n              majors always come up at interviews and networking events, and\r\n              I've gotten positive feedback on the range of skills learnt in the\r\n              pairing- especially how learning information systems is a great\r\n              choice in an increasingly digitized world.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Overall, my information systems degree has enabled me to be well\r\n              equipped for a tech-driven future, develop strong technical acumen\r\n              through skills like Java and business analysis, and explore a\r\n              range of career fields.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What skills do you think are important to continue to develop for\r\n              your future career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I feel that self-motivation is an essential skill that sets people\r\n              apart - no matter what career or industry you're in. YOU are the\r\n              only person who can define your career and it's up to you seek out\r\n              and put effort into achieving your ambitions. Everyone has times\r\n              of self-doubt where they feel that their dreams are out of reach,\r\n              but what sets people apart is whether they can overcome these\r\n              thoughts to achieve their goals! By having a self-starter\r\n              attitude, you'll empower yourself to remain driven in the face of\r\n              setbacks and be able to recognize opportunity intuitively. It's\r\n              also valuable to employers who are always looking for proactive\r\n              candidates.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The ability to adapt to new situations, work under pressure and\r\n              problem solve are also important skills. The business landscape is\r\n              constantly changing, which means that you need to be prepared for\r\n              unfamiliar business problems that you can't Google the answers to\r\n              (sadly). Having these skills will allow you to embrace and rise\r\n              above challenges at work and your career- facing times of stress\r\n              with resilience to deliver strong results. You can grow these\r\n              skills in many ways throughout uni- joining societies in\r\n              subcommittee or executive positions. It is particularly great in\r\n              growing your ability to meet deadlines under pressure and adapt to\r\n              unexpected circumstances.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Finally, I think having some technological acumen is important in\r\n              an increasingly digitized world. Whether this means having a\r\n              technical skill like Java or Python, or being able to understand\r\n              concepts like blockchain. Technological change has become a\r\n              constant, and it's important to be aware of relevant trends and\r\n              innovations for your industry.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are some of the technical skills you learned in your\r\n              information system degree?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              SQL was the first language that I learnt in the degree. It stands\r\n              for Structured Query Language and is the primary language used to\r\n              interact with relational databases. SQL is in high-demand within\r\n              all industries in an increasingly data-driven world- it's critical\r\n              in enabling us to access and manage data. This in turn enables the\r\n              user to create meaningful insights from the extracted data. For\r\n              example, I've talked to marketers who have used SQL to capture\r\n              customer data and actions, from which they can easily analyze\r\n              things like target market demographics and the effectiveness of an\r\n              advertising campaign.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Java is another key language that you learn. Java is a programming\r\n              language that is intended to let app developers 'write once, run\r\n              anywhere'. You use Java to build so many things- from mobile,\r\n              desktop and web apps to video games. I love how there is an\r\n              infinite amount of possibilities as to what you can create, and\r\n              it's a great one to learn if you're considering a path in\r\n              innovation.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"georgie-mansfield\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/georgie.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Georgie Mansfield\",\r\n              \"Education Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n            \"elisa-sanjurjo\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/elisa.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Elisa Sanjurjo\",\r\n              \"Education team\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost35;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost36 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.png\" title=\"Blog Post #36\" />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>The Small, the Powerful…The Byte</h2>\r\n            <p className={styles.date}>1st November 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The byte.

A bit is the smallest\r\n              increment of data, and can only be made up of binary digits, for\r\n              those not as technologically advanced like myself 0 or 1. It is\r\n              from the 8-bit byte that computers can produce letters, numbers,\r\n              or symbols. One byte has up to 28 or 256 different combinations,\r\n              that form the hundreds of possibilities of technology and hold\r\n              even more data and information that we experience and use in\r\n              everyday life.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>So why 8 bits?</p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Funnily enough, early computer systems did attempt to use 5-bit\r\n              code, giving a mere 32 possible combinations, which was practical\r\n              if you only wanted lowercase letters of the English alphabet and a\r\n              few symbols. Unsurprisingly, this did not suffice. Trying to keep\r\n              it as minimal as possible, the 6-bit byte was then implemented and\r\n              used in a variety of IBM technologies, and with 26 or 64\r\n              possibilities, uppercase and lowercase letters with more symbols.\r\n              But still, limitations urged the development of more, and though a\r\n              7-bit byte was considered adequate (and is still used for Unicode\r\n              character sets), in 1970 the Intel 8080 became the first\r\n              widely-accepted 8-bit microprocessor.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>The Small, the Powerful</p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              There’s a deep history and amazing complexity surrounding the\r\n              byte, much more than we can express here.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              But it’s not just that the byte is important, that it’s used\r\n              everyday in our lives, that it makes social media, typing, and\r\n              even pictures possible… but it’s that{\" \"}\r\n              <em>we can be like the byte.</em>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n                  A byte is tiny, yet essential.

Combining this with the support,\r\n              the collaboration of other people around us, what may feel like\r\n              our individual, meaningless aspirations are catalysed into the\r\n              stories that make up our journey.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The byte is tiny and absolutely invisible, and sometimes we feel\r\n              tiny and invisible and our efforts feel pointless, but those\r\n              efforts make our <strong>foundation</strong> and the contribution\r\n              of other people, or if you like, other bytes, make our journey\r\n              worthwhile, are the supporting characters in our story that make\r\n              the hardships, the failure and the journey worthwhile.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Technology is so much more than just code.

My teacher could see how much I loved the\r\n              subject and challenged me to start learning how to code. It was\r\n              very simple and early stages of learning how to program but the\r\n              level of analytical and logical thinking really interested me. I\r\n              always knew that I loved Mathematics as well so I was naturally\r\n              inclined to Engineering. The more I learnt to code and about the\r\n              technological industry, I knew I wanted to keep learning in this\r\n              field and that is how I joined the STEM field as a Software\r\n              Engineer.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I started my career in Technology at a very young age. I was 15\r\n              when I secured an Internship at Google. I worked tirelessly to get\r\n              this role and I was driven to make a difference for other\r\n              students. At 16, I worked at a tech platform that connected\r\n              industries to students. The company secured a $1 million\r\n              investment. I didn’t want to stop. I wanted to make a difference.\r\n              My passion to be a leader in the IT industry landed me a role as a\r\n              Technical Specialist at Apple, making me one of the youngest. I\r\n              became one of the first Women to be awarded an Engineering\r\n              Scholarship at the University of Technology Sydney for a Bachelor\r\n              of Software Engineering (Honours) with a Diploma of Professional\r\n              Engineering Practice. Till now, I have had the opportunity to work\r\n              in different companies such as Apple, Cuscal, CSIRO and WiseTech\r\n              Global. I have always been proactively involved in roles that will\r\n              allow me to implement significant changes in current practices\r\n              within the company or in the technology they use.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              My drive is to make an impact and create ripples of change around\r\n              me.

In the future, I see myself being a leader in\r\n              my field and creating a vision. I want to be able to design a\r\n              sustainable lifestyle with technology in the developing countries\r\n              to truly increase the life quality and standard to the best of my\r\n              ability.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>What do you love about your career now?</p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Too many things, but I will keep it short. What I love about my\r\n              career is that it is always changing and evolving into something\r\n              better. I love the idea of improving, whether that means personal\r\n              growth or even if it makes automating something small for more\r\n              effective and efficient results. I am grateful that I have a lot\r\n              of experience for my age and I love that I can keep aiming for\r\n              high and trying new opportunities and roles. Technology and STEM\r\n              related careers allow you to think big and outside the box. It is\r\n              not narrow. I love that even if I love coding now, I still have\r\n              the knowledge and ability to be in a non-technical role. The\r\n              skills are interchangeable and as a young person in the early\r\n              stages of their career, it really inspires me to keep pushing hard\r\n              and making the most of all opportunities.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Why do you think it is important to empower women and increase\r\n              their involvement in the STEM industry?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              This is so important!

There have been so many instances,\r\n              too many to count where I am the only woman in a meeting, in a\r\n              group assignment or in a lab. When you empower someone else, you\r\n              have no idea how you can change their life. You have the ability\r\n              to share your own experiences in the hope that they will take\r\n              something, even a little bit out of it and make progress towards\r\n              their goals. This is how we inspire others. By empowering other\r\n              women and by actively increasing involvement in the STEM industry,\r\n              we are creating ripples of goodness around us and breaking the\r\n              stereotypes in STEM careers. If we work towards this, there may be\r\n              a time when women do not feel inferior to take action.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I believe the hardest thing for me so far has been truly\r\n              understanding what I want to do in my career, and stepping away\r\n              from the pressure around me to specialise in certain technical\r\n              areas. I have found that with so many options in technology and\r\n              something so broad, I sometimes wake up and feel like I should\r\n              know what is going on in every single field, that I often forget\r\n              to slow down and enjoy the journey.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your\r\n              career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              At the beginning of my career, I always went to networking events\r\n              to meet new people and just have simple conversations. I was\r\n              always inspired by people’s courage and passion in what they did.\r\n              I have had some of the most amazing mentors, from a young age that\r\n              have given me amazing insights into their career and how I can\r\n              improve. As I have progressed into my own career, I have started\r\n              to see that every single person has a different story and it is\r\n              about embracing those that are like minded to you but also those\r\n              that are different. Everyone you meet will show you a different\r\n              perspective, but it is about how you can give it the power to\r\n              change and inspire you.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the hard and soft skills that you advised students who\r\n              are interested in pursuing a similar career path (for\r\n              internship/graduate role) to upskill on?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Have a good balance of both hard and soft skills!

We now are striving to increase awareness surrounding colour\r\n              blindness and help to make the world more accessible.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Please tell us a little bit about your university experience\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I’m studying a double degree (Advanced Science and Engineering)\r\n              majoring in Psychology and Software Engineering. I previously\r\n              majored in Aerospace Engineering, during which time I was a member\r\n              of FLU (Flight Labs UNSW) - a society that predominantly builds\r\n              flying drones. Now that eXsight is building a software-based\r\n              product, I want to use my Software Engineering degree to help.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How did your university experience help you start eXsight?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Being at UNSW opened my eyes to the possibility of turning my\r\n              small concept into a startup business. It also allowed me to meet\r\n              Maggie (eXsight’s Co-Founder) and introduced me to opportunities\r\n              and mentors that I would never otherwise have had access to. All\r\n              of this combined is what motivates me to continue eXsight.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Can you tell us about the process of starting and building\r\n              eXsight?

Since we’re both studying at the\r\n              same time, we often have to put eXsight on hold now and again in\r\n              order to manage other commitments.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Who did you turn to for help along the way?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The UNSW Founders program was a major help throughout the entire\r\n              process and eXsight would definitely not be where it is today, or\r\n              even exist, without the help of the programs Maggie and I have\r\n              been a part of. The Founders program is what allowed us to meet\r\n              outside individuals and organisations as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What valuable lessons did you learn whilst developing eXsight?\r\n              What skills did you pick up?{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              We learnt a lot about the importance of listening to your target\r\n              market - neither Maggie nor I are colour blind, so we have to go\r\n              by what people who are colour blind tell us about their\r\n              experiences. Because of this barrier to understanding the true\r\n              problem, we were working on a product for over a year that we\r\n              later realised wasn’t even addressing the true issues people were\r\n              talking to us about. We’ve also learnt the importance of putting\r\n              yourself out there and learned that there are a lot of people out\r\n              there who really want to help small businesses - there’s a ‘give\r\n              back’ sort of mindset within the startup community where people\r\n              want to help each other out, and I really love that.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What was the biggest challenge you faced whilst developing eXsight\r\n              and how did you overcome it?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Probably having to drop our original idea in order to create\r\n              something new that solved the problem better. It was really hard\r\n              to put aside all the hard work we’d done and essentially start\r\n              from scratch, but it was essential if we wanted to actually create\r\n              something meaningful and helpful for people. Keeping the long term\r\n              benefits in mind, as well as our goals for ourselves and our\r\n              business, is what helped us make the decision to pivot.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What advice would you give to prospective students who wish to\r\n              start their own technology projects?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I would highly recommend reaching out to existing startups and\r\n              small businesses. From my experience, everyone is willing to help\r\n              out and a lot of people will be willing to have a chat with you in\r\n              exchange for a coffee. It’s also important to find other people\r\n              who share your passions and are willing to put in the work to\r\n              start a small business - it’s a lot of work and I really wouldn’t\r\n              recommend trying to do it all on your own.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What do you hope to be doing in future?

Ultimately we’d really like to release a\r\n              product that makes a difference in the world and makes life\r\n              easier/more enjoyable for people.

Although so many of us take the opportunity to set a New Year’s resolution, almost 80% of us also give up on that goal. But it’s not just New Year’s resolutions that we give up on, it’s the regular “new term, new me” that almost all of us have heard or said, the out-of-the-blue determination to start exercising, eating better, working harder, achieve something bigger and more exciting, that starts so slowly, but then accelerates so rapidly to turn from an ambitious goal to something we once wanted to do.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf these new, big, and exciting goals we decide to embark on in the blink of an eye are so easy for us to abandon, how do we change this mindset?

We took our soft toy to bed, to the shops, outside, in the rain, through the mud, it was part of us. Likewise, the determination to achieve our goals need to become part of us too, something that we notice has an impact in our daily lives no matter how specific the goal is.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe loved the soft toy. We brushed it, dressed it, and played with it. We had an emotional connection with our soft toy, and likewise we should with our goals. The emotional connection to goals gives us the drive and motivation to achieve them, as well as emphasising the personal gain we get from them. The emotional connection can be as simple as the visualisation of how proud you will be when you achieve the goal, all the way to the visualisation that the achievement of the goal will have great impacts upon your everyday life.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThen trouble strikes with our soft toy. We get sick and have to wash it, the toy gets torn, the toy is lost or ruined. Equally, our goals are like this, achieving ambitious goals is difficult to do, and whether it’s the simplicity in washing your dirty soft toy, or the tiring and frustrating search of finding the toy you lost, you will find a solution to the challenges and know that it will be ok.\r\n            </p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, we may also lose the toy all together. It’s a devastating but also natural part of goal setting that sometimes they just don’t work out. But just as we overcame losing our soft toy as a child, we will overcome the goal that didn’t work out too.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEventually, our parting moment comes. We grow out of our soft toys, we become a big kid, lose the emotional connection, and begin looking for bigger and more mature things to do.

Afterwards, she enjoyed a\r\n              placement in the Particles and Catalysis Research Group (PARTCAT)\r\n              of UNSW, and continued with the group for her PhD programme from\r\n              2016 to 2020.

One method is to\r\n              utilise CO2 as a feedstock for fuel production. My PhD research\r\n              focused on the engineering of nickel catalysts for carbon dioxide\r\n              hydrogenation to methane. The reaction aims to promote process\r\n              sustainability by occurring under photothermal conditions,\r\n              dependent on the light-to-heat conversion. Similar to most\r\n              chemical reactions, a catalyst is needed for the reaction. The\r\n              scope of my work involved probing the impact of catalyst support\r\n              properties, separating the effects of light and heat in the\r\n              reaction, and understanding the role of defects in the catalyst.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the limitations of your research?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Relative to other conditions of CO2 conversion to methane,\r\n              photothermal conditions and the number of catalysts tested have\r\n              not been probed as extensively. Therefore, there are limitations\r\n              in terms of understanding such as on the catalyst properties that\r\n              influence the reaction.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What inspired you to explore your research topic?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Prior to my PhD studies, my research project during the MEng\r\n              programme (at the University of Sheffield) also involved utilising\r\n              CO2 as a building block. I found the concept to be very\r\n              interesting because it involved producing a valuable product from\r\n              something that would have essentially become ‘waste’. I was drawn\r\n              by the sustainability aspect of the process and how it addresses\r\n              the current environmental issues.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What challenges/conflicts have you faced in your studies or your\r\n              research?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              There’s a lot of new skills to learn and responsibilities to\r\n              undertake, which can be challenging at first. However, it’s just a\r\n              matter of working through it and over time, new concepts would be\r\n              easier to grasp. Challenges can also be a source of motivation,\r\n              such as when testing a new material and anticipating the result.\r\n              Some experiments take several hours or days, and waiting to\r\n              observe the outcome is very exciting.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What skills are most important in order to successfully complete a\r\n              research project?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              In my experience, the skills I found important were time\r\n              management, perseverance, patience, creativity, and communication.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What piece of advice would you give your younger self?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I would say that my experience at the beginning of my PhD\r\n              programme was a steep learning curve. There was a lot to learn,\r\n              process, and skills to acquire. I think that the advice I would\r\n              give to my younger self would be to be patient with myself, always\r\n              be proactive in seeking resolution, and the importance of a\r\n              supportive network. Guidance and support from attentive\r\n              supervisors also have a strong influence on the experience.\r\n              Additionally, I frequently talk through my ideas and challenges\r\n              with friends, who were great at listening and help process my\r\n              thoughts. It is equally important for me to be present and\r\n              supportive.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I would also tell myself to find a hobby or learn new skills. It’s\r\n              a good way to give yourself a break.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How did you open opportunities for yourself?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I think that it’s important to be proactive with your goals,\r\n              consistently work on improving skills, and be enthusiastic to\r\n              learn new things. Based on my experience, when I was an undergrad\r\n              student, I knew that I wanted to do a PhD degree after graduation\r\n              and so I was keen to do research placements during my university\r\n              breaks. Finding a placement definitely takes time and motivation.\r\n              As I was looking for work experience in Australia while I was in\r\n              England, I started almost one year prior to find a placement. I\r\n              was very fortunate to have gained research experience at the\r\n              Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation\r\n              (CSIRO) in Melbourne and with PARTCAT at UNSW during the summer\r\n              after Year 2 and 3, respectively. The experience from both places\r\n              were invaluable and I am incredibly grateful to my supervisors and\r\n              colleagues.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              In your opinion, what are the most important skills needed in the\r\n              workforce?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I would say that the important skills are honesty, time\r\n              management, critical thinking, and communication. My PhD studies\r\n              was definitely a time that I’ve acquired many technical skills and\r\n              new understanding, which are transferable to the workforce. There\r\n              are also non-technical skills developed which builds your\r\n              character.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What is your biggest eye-opening moment in recent years?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              In terms of research, it’s very interesting to read on new\r\n              findings and developments in the area of interest, which inspires\r\n              and shifts your perspective on an issue.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              As for personal reflection, it’s interesting to see how far my\r\n              life has come since high school and the unexpected events that\r\n              happen.

But STEM was not her first\r\n              choice. Initially, Marguerite was drawn to classical music and\r\n              dreamed of becoming a music therapist. Whilst reading the\r\n              discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson, Marguerite fell\r\n              in love with DNA in high school. She expressed that “I loved the\r\n              idea of solving something at the molecular level”, and was\r\n              immediately drawn to the complexities and excited by the\r\n              challenges in science.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Graduating with a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from UNSW, Marguerite\r\n              was enthusiastic to start her career in the US as a postdoctoral\r\n              fellow at the University of Utah. Here, she really began to\r\n              understand the premise of a male-dominant culture in STEM. As a\r\n              leading advocate for women in technology, Margarite does not\r\n              believe there is any lack of interest, passion, or ambition for\r\n              girls and women to enter the STEM field. However, she outlines\r\n              that the field has not been the most accommodating to women,\r\n              especially for those who want families. She finds that the rolling\r\n              contracts and competitive atmosphere in STEM are unforgiving for\r\n              women who take career breaks to have a child, posing as a\r\n              significant barrier for women interested in STEM.

Here, she published her first academic article in the\r\n              Science publication, “Molecular Therapy.” A few years later, she\r\n              joined the clinical team at the Bruce Lefroy Centre for Genetic\r\n              Health Research at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in\r\n              Australia, where she works to this day and has published 15 more\r\n              scholarly works. She helped develop cell and gene therapies for\r\n              Friedreich’s Ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease that affects\r\n              children. The goal of her research is to understand disease\r\n              mechanisms and develop safe, effective therapies for Friedreich\r\n              ataxia that readily translate to the clinic. As a result,\r\n              therapies services will be more accessible to patients from\r\n              different backgrounds who are diagnosed with Friedreich’s Ataxia\r\n              backgrounds.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              As Marguerite’s career has blossomed, she has devoted herself to\r\n              inspiring more women and students into STEM. In 2017, she became\r\n              the Executive Director for the Industry Mentoring Network for\r\n              STEM. ” She serves on the steering committee of the Science in\r\n              Australia Gender Equity Forum and is the co-founder of Women in\r\n              Science, Australia. Reflecting on her work, she expresses that “I\r\n              work with a lot of young people in research and sometimes you have\r\n              to say to them “don’t worry, be happy!” Try not to worry about the\r\n              future. Just embrace it and go for it.\" Having received numerous\r\n              awards for her research and leadership, Marguerite says all of it\r\n              was possible due to her “sheer and utter determination.”\r\n              Marguerite’s success is living, breathing, proof that there is a\r\n              place for women in STEM, in research, in the hard sciences. She\r\n              admits that it is a difficult path, yet the obstacles look\r\n              surmountable, and the rewards large because of women like\r\n              Marguerite.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"vivian-wong\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/vivw.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\r\n              \"Education Executive\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost8;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost9 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.png\" title=\"Blog Post #9\" />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\r\n              What Are You <em>Really</em> Procrastinating?\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p className={styles.blogSubtitle}>\r\n              Inspired by Tim Urban’s TED Talk “Inside the Mind of a Master\r\n              Procrastinator”\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.date}> 29th June 2020 </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <div className={styles.videoWrapper}>\r\n              <iframe\r\n                title=\"Tim Urban’s TED Talk “Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator” \"\r\n                width=\"560\"\r\n                height=\"315\"\r\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/arj7oStGLkU\"\r\n                frameborder=\"0\"\r\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\r\n                allowfullscreen=\"true\"\r\n                webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\r\n                mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\r\n              />\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              To be honest, I don’t consider myself a master procrastinator.
