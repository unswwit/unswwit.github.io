We often hear people say that they need to "sleep on it" when contemplating big decisions, or have you ever woken up and the answer to your problems is now at the centre of your mind. Research shows that this problem solving, and creative control arises from REM sleep.'),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("p",{className:m.a.postContent},"However, memory consolidation occurs during NREM. In this phase, all the thoughts, ideas, and pieces of information we have stored in our short-term memory (stored in a region of the brain called the hippocampus) are transferred and consolidated to the Cortex. Critically, recalling information from long term memory can only occur if we have fallen asleep. Interestingly, Walker uses the metaphor of sleep, acting as a computer hard drive recovery service salvaging presumably deleted memory files. For instance, facts that we have forgotten soon after learning, such as a name or order of operations are recalled easily upon waking from a good night of sleep, leading to the lightbulb moment."),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("p",{className:m.a.postContent},"Additionally, Dr Robert Stickgold, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, conducted a study in which students had to learn a visual memory task through repetition.

Another group received a poor night of sleep (less than 8 hours) after learning and were tested three days later (the other nights having sufficient hours of sleep). This group failed to perform the memory task. Thus, Dr Stickgold\u2019s research concluded that it is imperative to receive a good night of sleep after learning for memory consolidation.

A small part of the project was Googling and using Stack Overflow to find tutorials and code examples that we could use since we were relatively new to personal projects. In terms of time commitment, the project was very flexible and fit within our schedules.
