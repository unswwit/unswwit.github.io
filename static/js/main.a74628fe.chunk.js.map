Her passions collide in her role as a senior\n              consultant of the SuccessFactors Team at PwC Australia. With a\n              keen understanding of her client’s strategic business objectives\n              and the feasibility of system design, she thrives in creating\n              solutions for clients that allow them to operate more efficiently.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Let’s read what Silvia had to say about her journey into tech\n              below\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What sparked your interest to join the field of STEM?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I definitely \"stumbled\" into the field of STEM, it was never an\n              area quite popular in highschool when we are picking our future\n              degrees. I was introduced to it as part of the Co-op program and\n              just went with it since I didn't know what to do. Mind you I\n              definitely struggled in my first year of studying tech, I\n              definitely thought I was the odd one out, was struggling to\n              understand basic concepts of SQL and was prepared to quit and\n              leave it all behind. I definitely think the turning point was\n              meeting Blair, who gave me a personalised presentation slides of\n              why I/women should stay in tech and the Info systems support\n              circle that really opened my eyes about the opportunities in tech.\n              I definitely would not have lasted my first year of uni without\n              any of them. Once you enter the industry you realise how many\n              awesome opportunities there are, and that there is definitely a\n              role for everyone regardless what background you come from. It's\n              not just all coding, or all project management. There's a happy\n              space for everyone.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I have been quite fortunate in working at several amazing places\n              within the tech industry. I started off a planning and research\n              analyst at the Reserve Bank of Australia, before trying out the\n              Cyber security space in IAG. I then interned at PwC's Experience\n              and Insights Team and gave a shot at strategy consulting at\n              Deloitte's S&I team. I am now a senior consultant in PwC's\n              Technology Consulting team, specifically in the SuccessFactors\n              team.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Absolutely no idea! I think over the years I have realised certain\n              aspects I enjoy, and that is I like to help people and clearly see\n              that my work is contributing to a good cause. I am always learning\n              regardless where I end up, so I try not to aim for a \"final\n              destination\", rather I think about what other areas I can learn\n              from. I definitely do want to move to another country just to\n              understand how the tech industry is like in another geographic\n              region.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What do you love about your career now?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I love how I get to try out a variety of roles and work with\n              different industries. What was really interesting for me was that\n              I was the second member of the SuccessFactors team alongside my\n              director, and really I got to help build the team and work with\n              some amazing people - Kudos to Lynsye. Everyday I am not stuck at\n              a routine, yes sometimes certain days are tougher than others, but\n              it certainly makes it enjoyable when you see the impact your work\n              has to make your client's job run more efficiently and effectively\n              and by extension helping support our society.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>Favourite Quote or Motto?</p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              \"Do it for yourself, not to prove to others\" - Dr Carmen Leong\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"vivian-wong\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/vivw.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\n              \"Education Executive\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost1;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost10 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #10\" />\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\n              Introducing: Lana King, Senior Consultant of Deloitte\n            </h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>July 1, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Lana King is a Senior Consultant at Deloitte Australia,\n              specialising in Enterprise Technology exploring how information\n              technology resources and data are used across businesses and\n              projects.

Throughout the degree,\n              there will be various opportunities to interact with fellow\n              students and work on projects - so effective communication also\n              plays a very important role.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What piece of advice would you give your younger self?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I would tell my younger self to continue working without thinking\n              of the outcome and enjoy what you're studying.

And I also actively took\n              part in any volunteering opportunities I learned about. During the\n              second trimester, I volunteered for the RoboCup event at the ICC\n              and frankly, it was really amazing!\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              In your opinion, what are the most important skills needed in the\n              workforce?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Technical skills are important, like coding.

A\n              lot of difficulties arise when pursuing a degree.

This idea has been really\n              eye-opening. You not only tend to succeed in what you are\n              pursuing; you start to believe in yourself in a way you've never\n              before.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What would you like the impact of your degree to be?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The applications of AI are spreading far and wide - from\n              driverless cars to cybersecurity intelligence to virtual\n              assistants. I'd like my education to serve the society in a\n              positive way - for example, maybe work to better disease diagnosis\n              and medication to provide these facilities to people anytime\n              anywhere, or even security enhancement, where AI technology could\n              be used to understand and improve the cyber environment and help\n              prevent attacks.

Born in Germany to\n              parents in the US Air Force, she moved frequently, living in many\n              US states. While computers were primitive and novel during the\n              1980s, Erica had access to them earlier than most kids. Her mum\n              created combat plans for the Air Force on a computer in their\n              home, which Erica got to play on. In fifth grade, her teacher\n              selected her to go to a training for the precursor to the World\n              Wide Web and she was hooked. In an{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://techiesproject.com/erica-baker/\">\n                interview she had with Techies Project\n              </a>\n              , Erica recalls thinking, “I love this. I want to do this.” From\n              that moment on, Erica delved into the world of technology,\n              learning how to install programs, hack, and write code. Naturally,\n              she decided to study computer science at university. But attending\n              the University of Miami was not what she expected and she didn’t\n              like it. She was one of the only women and one of the only black\n              students. She felt like an outsider that wasn’t accepted, so she\n              transferred to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where she\n              earned an associate’s degree in what we would refer to today as\n              information technology. From there, she launched her career at the\n              university.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Erica’s experience at the University of Miami was the first of\n              many uncomfortable experiences she would have as a black woman\n              working in tech. Whilst working at Google a decade after\n              graduation, she recalls that the CEO mistook her as an assistant\n              instead of an engineer. When the CEO discovered she was an\n              engineer, he wanted to work with a male instead, and advised her\n              to hang a door sign that explained her role, unlike any other\n              engineers. The situation was not unique, and Erica grew frustrated\n              that her colleagues did not see her as capable as her white, male\n              counterparts. She came to realize that there were some workplace\n              cultures where she would not be able to succeed, no matter how\n              hard she was willing to work. This inspired her to advocate that\n              companies should not only hire but retain minority employees. It\n              also sparked her idea to create an internal spreadsheet where\n              Google employees reported their salary data to better understand\n              pay disparities within the company.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>Career Success</p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              In addition to Google, Erica has worked for other well known\n              companies in Silicon Valley including GitHub, Slack, Patreon, and\n              Microsoft.

In a 2016 interview with Techies Project, Erica said,\n              “Right now I get to have this voice—people listen to me for some\n              reason, and I have support at work to continue speaking about\n              these things; and permission to say whatever I feel from the CEO\n              of my company—which is super rare, Not everybody gets that. And\n              it’s a huge privilege, and so I’m not going to waste that\n              privilege. I want to use it to speak up so that we can make\n              improvements. I think the first step is talking about what’s going\n              on and then getting uncomfortable... And then we can move on to\n              fixing it.”\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              In addition to speaking on diversity and inclusion, Erica\n              advocates expanding access to tech education.

Soon\n              after, she joined her first amateur astronomical society. Her love\n              for astronomy, which she describes as “ridiculous” guided her\n              educational pursuits. By age 26, she had already earned a Ph.D. in\n              Radio Astronomy. Her work on the SKA Pathfinder telescope led to\n              the discovery of tens of millions of new galaxies. And if solving\n              the mysteries of the universe isn’t enough, in 2018, she was\n              appointed the Australian Government Ambassador for Women in STEM.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Dr. Harvey shares astronomical concepts with women in ways that\n              are interesting and accessible. She explains her reason for being\n              a science communicator and educator instead of a traditional\n              teacher is because: “I wanted to use my creativity rather than\n              teach in a confined setting – that’s what I love about science\n              communication, the creative aspect. The challenge of breaking out\n              of my science niche and cutting through the jargon and explaining\n              these cool concepts. I find it challenging and engaging and I love\n              watching people’s faces as the penny drops.”\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              If Dr. Harvey had to be described in one word, it would be\n              ambitious. When she’s not conducting astronomical research and\n              sharing her love of astronomy with others, she’s advocating for\n              women in the workplace. In her 10-year plan for Women in STEM, she\n              urges the need to accelerate the pace of change in reducing the\n              gender pay gap for women. In her address to the National Press\n              Club in 2019, she warned that it will take more than 200 years to\n              close the gap at the current rate of progress. Her research on\n              unconscious bias in the workplace and her advocacy has already led\n              to improvements in the hiring process. Companies are now removing\n              gendered pronouns in applications so that more women will receive\n              research grants and job opportunities.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Currently, women make up only 17% of the STEM qualified population\n              in Australia. Professor Harvey Smith advises that it is the\n              responsibility of students, educators, parents, and businesses to\n              encourage, promote, and raise awareness for all women in STEM. As\n              an author for young children, her wish is for young girls to see\n              smart and empowering female leaders involved in science and\n              technology and feel a part of the STEM community. She urges,\n              “Instead of asking girls what the colour of the flower is, ask how\n              many flowers there are.” By encouraging young females to think\n              mathematically and scientifically, she believes more females will\n              seek careers in STEM and gender equity will become the norm.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Professor Lisa Harvey Smith shows us that successful females not\n              only have love, determination and exploration for their own\n              fields, but they also make time to encourage women in STEM.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Professor Lisa Harvey Smith is currently the Professor of Practice\n              at UNSW.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"elisa-sanjurjo\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/elisa.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Elisa Sanjurjo\",\n              \"Education Team\",\n            ],\n            \"victoria-ruming\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/victoria.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Victoria Ruming\",\n              \"Education Team\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost2;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost20 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #20\" />\n\n        {/*End of Header*/}\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\n              Introducing : Aneita Yang, Product Manager At Atlassian\n            </h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>September 2, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Aneita Yang is product manager of Bitbucket Cloud at Atlassian, a\n              program that allows teams to manage workflow from design to\n              implementation as well as edit and deploy the code these teams are\n              working on.

I graduated from Sydney University in 2017 with a\n              Bachelor of Civil (Environmental) Engineering, and during my\n              penultimate year at university I was an undergraduate at AECOM in\n              their Urban Systems Advisory team (sustainability planning).\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              In the future I see myself in a role more geared towards combating\n              climate change and building a sustainable future. I maintain a\n              long held interest in environmental justice and climate change,\n              and practice a number of related initiatives in my day to day\n              life. However, I am interested in getting experience across a\n              range of sectors and with different people in the early stages of\n              my career.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What do you love about your career now?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I love the people that I work with in my current role at KPMG,\n              there is an inclusive culture with friendly people from diverse\n              backgrounds. There are also a wide range of career opportunities\n              both at KPMG and in the wider industry with an engineering\n              background.

STEM related industries are responsible for designing\n              many things that each of us use in our day to day lives which\n              affect both females and males. Did you know that when Siri first\n              came out it was 70% more accurate when recognising a males voice\n              than a females, and that female car crash dummies only started\n              being tested in this decade? If females are not in the room then\n              decisions are made without a female perspective, and that affects\n              the female customer base. In the case of the car crash dummies,\n              that's a matter of female safety. It's the same for all different\n              types of diversity. A Harvard study suggests that there needs to\n              be at least 3 in 10 of a minority group in the room to impact a\n              decision being made and according to Engineers Australia 84% of\n              Australian engineering graduates are men, so there is still so\n              much work to do to get females into STEM related careers.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              As I'm early on in my career I am constantly learning.

My peers inspire me and also senior leaders both\n              inside the organisations I've worked in and outside of these\n              organisations. I take inspiration from those who demonstrate\n              leadership, are passionate about what they do, and have a strong\n              commitment to social and environmental ethics. I also really value\n              mentoring and have been both a mentee and mentor in a number of\n              cases, gaining valuable benefits from both sides.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What are the hard and soft skills that you advised students who\n              are interested in pursuing a similar career path (for\n              internship/graduate role) to upskill on?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Soft skills such as communication, time management and working in\n              a team are really important skills to have in the workforce. The\n              hard skills will come through your degree without really any\n              further work. Coming into the workforce in a STEM career you are\n              hired for your potential and problem solving capability which you\n              would have gained through a STEM related degree. The soft skills\n              are often what you are assessed on throughout graduate recruitment\n              processes - typical questions in a graduate interview for a STEM\n              related graduate role will relate to how you work in a team, how\n              you have managed difficult conversations such as when someone\n              didn't agree with you or how you manage your time. Such skills can\n              be built up by casual work through your time at university (that\n              doesn't need to be STEM related), plus getting involved in\n              volunteering initiatives, university societies and other\n              extracurricular activities.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What is one piece of advice that you would give to your younger\n              self back in university?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Work hard but make time for yourself - hobbies, a casual job,\n              spending time with family and friends.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>Favourite Quote or Motto?</p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Always make time for yourself, no matter how busy you are.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"vivian-wong\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/vivw.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\n              \"Education Executive\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost21;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost22 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #22\" />\n\n        {/*End of Header*/}\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\n              4 Ways Technology is Changing how we make Art\n            </h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>September 13, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Technology is not all about maths and science.

Before this book, I would drink an average of\n              two cups of coffee a day and sleep around 7 hours per night. I led\n              a very active lifestyle and thought that I was pretty on top of my\n              health. What I did not understand was the vast implications of\n              cutting down hours of sleep and how it impacted not only my\n              neurological health but every other facet of my general health.\n              Whilst there is a long list of benefits or lack thereof when you\n              sleep for less than 8 hours, I want to share a secret I learned\n              about the best study hack to ace your exams, and the answer is\n              SLEEP.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              When we sleep, we go through two distinct phases, the first being\n              REM (Rapid-Eye-Movement) Sleep and NREM (Non-Rapid-Eye-Movement)\n              Sleep. REM sleep fuels creativity. It is a time for our brain to\n              connect past experiences and emotions to build a more accurate\n              representation of how our world works. We often hear people say\n              that they need to \"sleep on it\" when contemplating big decisions,\n              or have you ever woken up and the answer to your problems is now\n              at the centre of your mind. Research shows that this problem\n              solving, and creative control arises from REM sleep.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              However, memory consolidation occurs during NREM. In this phase,\n              all the thoughts, ideas, and pieces of information we have stored\n              in our short-term memory (stored in a region of the brain called\n              the hippocampus) are transferred and consolidated to the Cortex.\n              Critically, recalling information from long term memory can only\n              occur if we have fallen asleep. Interestingly, Walker uses the\n              metaphor of sleep, acting as a computer hard drive recovery\n              service salvaging presumably deleted memory files. For instance,\n              facts that we have forgotten soon after learning, such as a name\n              or order of operations are recalled easily upon waking from a good\n              night of sleep, leading to the lightbulb moment.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Additionally, Dr Robert Stickgold, a researcher at Harvard Medical\n              School, conducted a study in which students had to learn a visual\n              memory task through repetition. One group of participants received\n              a good night of sleep (8+ hours) on the day of learning and then\n              tested three days later. They had good memory recall. Another\n              group received a poor night of sleep (less than 8 hours) after\n              learning and were tested three days later (the other nights having\n              sufficient hours of sleep). This group failed to perform the\n              memory task. Thus, Dr Stickgold’s research concluded that it is\n              imperative to receive a good night of sleep after learning for\n              memory consolidation. It does not matter if you catch up on sleep\n              the days after. Memory consolidation is an all or nothing event.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              To sleep 8+ hours the night before a big study day is proven to be\n              incredibly efficient. In doing so, you are emptying and cleaning\n              the slate for the short-term memory centre of the hippocampus to\n              be ready to absorb new information. The hippocampus like a USB has\n              a limited storage capacity and sleep is incredibly important in\n              enabling fact-based learning to occur.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <div className={styles.postContent}>\n              The KEY takeaways that I hope you have now gained are:\n              <ul className={styles.list}>\n                <li>\n                  Before exams, aim to sleep for 8 hours! In doing so, you are\n                  moving all your information from short term to long term\n                  memory, so all the facts needed to ACE your exam are ready to\n                  be recalled.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  You need a good night of sleep before your study day to wipe\n                  the slate clean and absorb new information.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  Honestly, when in doubt, go to bed and sleep.

I enjoy cooking, video games, and\n              watching anime in my spare time.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              <strong>Felicia(F)</strong>: I’m a Software Eng/Commerce student\n              who loves baking, music (I play classical guitar), and graphic\n              design - something I get to do a lot of as WIT’s Marketing Exec!\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>What is LinkUp?</p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: It’s a uni event tracker to help find events happening at your\n              uni.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              F: By collating society events, we aim to help students find\n              ‘their people’ in the student community, as well as help societies\n              reach more students.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What inspired you to create LinkUp?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              D: I am actually from QLD, and when I first came to UNSW O-week I\n              didn’t know anyone, so I was trying my best to go to every\n              workshop/society stalls. However, finding events and workshops\n              around campus was difficult and scattered over multiple mediums\n              (UNSW website, Eventbrite, Facebook), and I wondered why there\n              wasn’t an easier way to navigate events on campus.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              How did LinkUp become affiliated with Arc? How did you pitch your\n              idea?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              F: Arc actually reached out to us after seeing our posts on the\n              UNSW Discussion Group! They loved how we were making it easier for\n              students to be involved with uni life and offered their support.\n              It was a great experience working with them.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Who was on the founding team and what roles did you have\n              allocated? After the project took off, were more people recruited\n              to join the team?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              D: LinkUp started off with me, Zhou and Felicia. I worked mainly\n              on the frontend of the website while Zhou worked on backend and\n              devops. Felicia was in charge of marketing. After a period of\n              growth, yes, we did decide to recruit more members to help LinkUp\n              become an even better product.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Can you tell us about the process of building LinkUp? What time\n              commitments did it require?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: Building LinkUp took a long time. The whole process involved\n              splitting the project into iterations so it was easier to handle,\n              and focused on building MVPs so we could iteratively improve them\n              later on. We experimented with code and features and researched\n              methods and solutions to our problem, which we defined earlier:\n              finding events. We also talked a lot with each other before making\n              decisions. A small part of the project was Googling and using\n              Stack Overflow to find tutorials and code examples that we could\n              use since we were relatively new to personal projects. In terms of\n              time commitment, the project was very flexible and fit within our\n              schedules. Some weeks we might have spent a few hours on it, and\n              others felt like a full-time job (often when we had nothing else\n              to do e.g,. summer holidays). We’ve probably spent well over a few\n              hundred hours so far on LinkUp.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              F: In terms of building our user base and reaching students, we\n              focused on Facebook discussion groups as the easiest way to reach\n              a large number of students.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What did you learn whilst creating LinkUp?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              D: LinkUp consists of a small and dedicated team, so I learned how\n              to work in a team and the importance of communication and time\n              management to deploy features on time. I also learned to work with\n              external parties to satisfy both Linkup’s needs and theirs.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: I learned how to use AWS to host our website, CDN and backend,\n              how to write scripts to scrape websites using Python and set up\n              continuous delivery for our repo. I also learned a bit of React so\n              I could help out with the frontend.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              F: I have definitely developed my teamwork and communication\n              skills along the way, but I also realised how lucky we are at UNSW\n              to have such an active and engaged student community. Society\n              events are a huge part of the uni experience at UNSW, in\n              comparison to other universities, and I’m really grateful for\n              that. It would be amazing if LinkUp could help shape student\n              communities in other unis as well.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What are some of the challenges you faced while creating LinkUp?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: Probably encountering a bug or error and not being able to find\n              a fix on Google. The best thing to do here is to take a break and\n              refresh your mind for a while, so when you come back, you can take\n              a different approach. Another challenge was finding the motivation\n              to do the project. This might be different for everyone, but I\n              found setting goals and thinking about the future helped me be\n              more motivated in creating LinkUp.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Who did you turn to for help along the way?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: Whenever we needed help, we would either Google it, ask our\n              teammates for help, or ask questions in relevant coding\n              communities available to us. Some supportive communities for\n              asking coding related questions are CSESoc workshops, Pcsoc\n              discord, r/learn programming, and other programming subreddits, a\n              certain UNSW society discord, and plenty of others.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              F: We also have talked to a wonderful mentor from UNSW Founders,\n              who helped guide us and focus on our goals.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What has been the most rewarding part of creating LinkUp?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              D: Seeing students using LinkUp and receiving feedback about how\n              much it has helped them find events around campus will continue to\n              be the most rewarding part of Linkup. Knowing that other people\n              are also finding value in a project that you spent so much time\n              and effort on will serve as a motivation to improve LinkUp\n              continually.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: While creating LinkUp, I realised how rewarding a personal\n              project can be and how much you can learn from the experience.\n              Personal projects are completely different from course projects\n              regarding how much control you have over your project. You get to\n              choose your own teammates without any restrictions, have a\n              flexible time commitment that fits in with your schedule, do\n              something you are interested in, plus so many other things.\n              Ultimately, this made it easier to learn the technologies required\n              to build LinkUp and learn what we were interested in. I highly\n              encourage everyone interested in software engineering to start a\n              personal project for something that interests them. There is just\n              so much you can learn from it.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              F: Like Deki, for me, it’s knowing students are using the site and\n              that we’re actually helping strengthen UNSW’s student community.\n              Every time a student or society contacts us with questions or\n              support, it’s super exciting and makes me want to do more.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What has been the initial impact of LinkUp? Have more students\n              joined societies?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: So far we have had 7.7k users and 12k sessions. We’re not too\n              sure of how much we impacted students joining societies, but it\n              has certainly made it easier to find events to go to.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              F: We’ve been impacted a lot by COVID, with many events being\n              postponed or canceled. But, we’ve received a lot of positive\n              feedback, so hopefully, as we move back on campus LinkUp can reach\n              even more people.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What’s next for LinkUp? What are your plans and goals and will you\n              be pursuing it after\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: We hope more students will use LinkUp, so we’re planning to add\n              many features to help make uni events better! We can’t say much\n              yet, but you can expect ways to give feedback for an event and a\n              voting system. We will still maintain it after graduation,\n              depending on how much time we have, but don’t expect any major\n              updates. This should be fine, though, as it doesn’t require much\n              time to maintain.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What advice would you give to other students who want to pursue a\n              personal project?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              D: If you have a personal project you are interested in, then I\n              would say just start it. If you need help learning the frameworks\n              or languages, there are so many great resources with my personal\n              favourite being Youtube and Codecademy.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Z: Do something you’re interested in, go to relevant workshops,\n              use your support (founders, CSESOC, WIT, etc,) and have fun.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              F: Think about what you want to achieve and why, write down your\n              goals, and celebrate every victory.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Deki, Zhou, and Felicia have built something that makes every\n              student’s life easier and more enriching at UNSW. Not many people\n              leave that sort of legacy! Along the way, they developed their\n              technical skills, overcome technical challenges, and explored\n              their interests. And of course, this project showcases their\n              skills in a unique way that will surely be attractive to many\n              employers. On behalf of all UNSW students, thank you Deki, Zhou,\n              and Felicia for volunteering your time to build something we love\n              so much! We hope you will find the knowledge and support you need\n              to reach all your LinkUp goals.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"vivian-wong\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/vivw.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\n              \"Education Executive\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost26;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost27 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #27\" />\n        {/*End of Header*/}\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\n              Introducing: Ankita Singh, PHD Student\n            </h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>September 30, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Ankita Singh is a PhD student at UNSW where she is optimising\n              analysis of rocks through techniques and concepts used by Harvard\n              Medical School and the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Ankita began\n              her journey as a student in petroleum engineering at UNSW where\n              she gained experience at Woodside energy in using and building\n              algorithms to determine amounts of oil and gas present, and helped\n              to improve analysis methods to develop greater accuracy, reduce\n              mathematical parameters, and minimise errors in data.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What sparked your interest to join the field of STEM?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Studying STEM gives us younger generations the chance to be the\n              change we want to see in society.

During my Bachelor's degree, I have contributed immensely\n              to the UNSW student community in the role of Peer mentor and\n              Petroleum Engineering Student Ambassador, and consequently, was\n              awarded the 'Engineering Student Service Award'. Since then, I am\n              pursuing doctoral studies at UNSW School of Minerals and Energy\n              Resources Engineering with a focus on image analysis, data\n              science, and rocks. To keep myself updated with the energy\n              industry, I have also had internships at Woodside Energy in Perth.\n              Finally, I look forward to finishing my doctoral studies in 2020\n              and be more involved with the energy industry to contribute to a\n              greener and cleaner future.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I really believe that the more exposure one has to real-world\n              problems, the better one can contribute to the community and think\n              out-of-box. As I finish my doctoral studies, I aim to get a\n              360-degree experience in petroleum, mining, renewable, and data\n              science industries.

As a\n              doctoral student, you learn to never give up and tackle the same\n              problem in so many different ways that it will amaze you how\n              thinking differently and collaborating can lead to great\n              innovations. Looking at my career in a broader sense, being a part\n              of such a diverse energy and resources industry, thrills me every\n              day because there is a vision that I can live up to and that is to\n              be able to bring electricity to those households who are currently\n              deprived of such luxuries.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              In the last few years, we have all witnessed that technology has\n              developed and progressed at a lightning speed. From a business\n              perspective, implementing some of these outstanding technologies\n              has been challenging in the mining and petroleum industry. This is\n              even the case when we know that we need it to keep the costs low\n              and be more efficient. Therefore, I think being able to use\n              state-of-the-art data science and cloud computing technologies to\n              bring in the value to the companies is a big challenge. More so,\n              there are multiple avenues to improve performance and address\n              issues such as climate change and human rights policies that help\n              the energy companies operate in harmony with everyone.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your\n              career?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              My family is my biggest inspiration.

Next we would spend the next 30-35 minutes answering\n                technical questions and wrap-up with ~5 minutes of questions you\n                would like to ask the interviewer.\n              </p>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                For the technical questions, you should expect to be given\n                either 1 hard question or 2 easy-medium questions for you to\n                CODE up in the 30-35 minutes. Following this, you will always be\n                asked about the time and space complexity of your code. You\n                should always begin by understanding the question asked. Spend\n                the next 2-3 minutes asking any clarifying questions (addressing\n                input/output types, asking how it might handle certain edge\n                cases) and think of test cases and confirming their intended\n                output. Then, you can think about your code implementation and\n                verbalize how you intend to implement the code. After the\n                interviewer has given you the 'green light' you should begin by\n                choosing your coding language and start coding it up.\n              </p>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                A: I’ve only done 1 technical interview and it was actually 55\n                minutes and one part of a three hour session.

For general software developer interviews, they\n                usually choose questions that can be answered in a range of\n                languages, so if you only know one language like C, that’s fine\n                - it just might take longer to answer. However, if you are\n                applying for a role with a specific language (e.g. C#\n                Developer), then your coding tests will most likely require you\n                to code in that language.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <li className={styles.question}>\n                How did you communicate your thought process / code\n                implementation to the interviewer?\n              </li>\n              <br />{\" \"}\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                V: You want to verbalise your thought process to the interview\n                as you code. This is actually a lot harder than you think\n                because we're not used to doing this. You should definitely take\n                the chance to practice a couple of mock interviews with friends\n                or at society events such as WIT where you can practice\n                technical interviews with company representatives.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"psot-content\">\n                A: Even with uni exams, I tend to write my plan of attack in\n                comments first (e.g. sort through this, loop through this then\n                find this). So during the interview, I would also be saying it\n                aloud too. Having those comments down just helps me target each\n                step of solving the question one by one (e.g. first I have to\n                sort, how do I sort, what’s the smartest way to sort).\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <li className={styles.question}>\n                What questions would you recommend asking the interviewer?\n              </li>\n              <br />{\" \"}\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                V: You should ask the interviewer about things you would want to\n                know about the company. Instead of the cliched, \"Tell me about\n                your role\" or \"How are you enjoying your work\", think about what\n                you would want to know about the company/role before you go in.\n              </p>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                I’m pretty sure I asked the typical “What projects do you work\n                on” but just because I was genuinely curious. I think it’s ok to\n                start off by asking these things but not just filler questions -\n                ask them if you actually want to know. That way, when they\n                reply, there will be particular parts that interest you which\n                you can ask more about. My interviewer was a backend developer\n                but I’m more interested in frontend so I asked about how the\n                different sides interacted, how tasks are separated/delegated,\n                why he chose backend and difference between intern and grad\n                application process.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <li className={styles.question}>\n                Did you ever get a question you didn’t know how to answer?

Something that worked for\n                me was to begin by how I would solve it logically without code\n                and then seeing how that would translate into code.\n              </p>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                A: Yes I have, even in coding tests.

I threw around suggestions of ways I could change\n                the data structure / algorithm I used. Not going to lie, I was\n                stalling for time to think but also hoped bouncing ideas off him\n                would help me see if I was going in the right direction. He\n                actually gave me a hint to point me in the right direction, and\n                I ended up getting it.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <li className={styles.question}>\n                What were some of the differences between the interview process\n                at different companies?{\" \"}\n              </li>\n              <br />{\" \"}\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                V: For a software engineering role, the interview process would\n                differ in terms of number of interviews, assessment days as well\n                as types of questions etc.\n              </p>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                Some companies such as Atassian would send through a HackerRank\n                test to help filter out applicants before they get to proceed to\n                a technical interview.

The banking sector, however, is facing a\n              different story. Thousands of new and up and coming fintech\n              start-ups are offering products and services that were\n              traditionally encompassed by traditional players in the banking\n              industry. While there will be losses in some areas, namely routine\n              and easily automatable tasks, these will be recouped through a\n              culture of innovation and collaboration. With most banks having a\n              deep and thorough understanding of financial services, as well as\n              generations of consumer trust, fintech companies are centered\n              around employees from a background other than finance. Thus, a\n              collaborative effort between the up and coming financial\n              technology sector and the traditional finance industry will carve\n              the future towards a more equitable, and accessible financial\n              services industry.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"jane-wang\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/jane-wang.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Jane Wang\",\n              \"Events Team\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost32;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost33 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #33\" />\n\n        {/*End of Header*/}\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>WCW ~ ALL WIT Exec Team 2020</h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>October 21, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What sparked your interest to study a STEM degree?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              <strong>Amanda</strong>: I always knew I wanted to have a job that\n              had both a creative and analytical/logical side and studying\n              software was the perfect combination of the two, being able to\n              design and implement products.

Change is\n              inevitable and at every milestone we achieve there’s an\n              uncertainty about the future and nostalgia of passed time.

Just like with the GFC\n              ten years ago, our lives have been upended by circumstances\n              outside of our control. For companies struggling to stay afloat,\n              graduate opportunities are the last thing on their mind, and there\n              is not much that we as students can do about that. Inevitably,\n              even fully qualified graduates like Shadiyah ten years ago, can be\n              left without a company that will offer them a place.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Even though I have a few years left at uni, I can’t pretend that I\n              haven’t been a little anxious that jobs will still be in short\n              supply when I graduate, and that doesn’t even compare to how tough\n              it is for the students graduating this year. Despite these\n              struggles, Shadiyah turned a difficult situation into new\n              opportunities that have led her to the successful career that she\n              has today.

If Shadiyah had found a\n              job directly after graduating, would she have found herself in\n              South Korea, or with a successful career in the tech industry in\n              Australia? Likewise, for us, we could discover new pathways that\n              lead to something which we couldn’t have imagined otherwise.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Don’t be afraid to put your hand up.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              <em>\n                “Be the person who isn’t afraid to put your hand up.

Hearing about how she moved from a writer to a\n              product owner at CBA without a traditional tech background, it’s\n              clear that these accomplishments came about by willingly stepping\n              up to challenges and going beyond what was expected of her.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              It’s easy to pre-empt failure and shy away from taking on the\n              challenges we face. Shadiyah emphasised the need to ask the people\n              around her for help when she was stuck, and the continual learning\n              she undertook. It’s about looking at challenges with a growth\n              mindset, because even when we do fail, we have gained important\n              lessons, and these lessons have great power in helping us the next\n              time we put our hands up.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              The future is at the intersection of business and technology.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              <em>\n                “Technology is ever-changing, so our customers' wants and needs,\n                as well as business’s wants and needs… If you can bridge\n                technical understanding with business and customer\n                understanding, that is gold.”\n              </em>\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The intersection of business and technology is at the heart of\n              what Shadiyah does as an Innovation Advisory Consultant at AWS.\n              She believes it is also at the heart of businesses moving\n              forwards.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Coming from a more technical background myself, I’ve usually been\n              interested in tech for its own sake. This opened my eyes to the\n              fact that to a business, its greatest value is in its ability to\n              help address its customers’ needs. In that sense, technology\n              innovation can’t exist in its own bubble. Businesses and customers\n              need to benefit from these innovations, and we can only achieve\n              that with an understanding of both tech capabilities and business\n              needs.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Recruiters look for someone who can inspire a team.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              <em>\n                “When I’m interviewing, I’m always looking for someone who can\n                demonstrate they were able to bring clarity to a situation, they\n                were able to make the people around them very confident, they\n                were able to build trust and attract desire to progress that\n                initiative further.”\n              </em>\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              We were super lucky that Shadiyah could offer a recruiter’s\n              perspective on the skills and attributes that she looks for in a\n              potential employee. What she said wasn’t quite what I expected to\n              hear from a recruiter.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I’ve heard plenty of times that employers are looking for someone\n              who takes initiative and is a capable problem solver. However,\n              Shadiyah suggests that it takes more than being able to solve\n              problems on your own. It’s about being able to inspire others to\n              believe in your solutions as well.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              This is a skill that can be developed by actively participating in\n              teamwork, whether that be at uni or outside of it. Following her\n              advice from earlier, putting your hand up to more challenges also\n              creates more opportunities to solve problems alongside other\n              people, and thus, the opportunity to inspire them as well.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              These lessons all add up to an overarching theme: that anything is\n              possible with the right mindset and an openness to learn. Shadiyah\n              embodied this attitude, and her energy was completely infectious.\n              Particularly in the uncertainty of a global pandemic, this belief\n              is more important than ever. With this in mind, the future holds\n              opportunities for all of us, as long as we take the initiative to\n              find them.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              For more amazing advice and to hear Shadiyah’s journey and more,\n              listen to our chat with Shadiyah in her Talk WIT Us episode,\n              available in these platforms!\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <div className={[styles.outerBox, styles.smallContainer].join(\" \")}>\n              <a\n                className={styles.innerBox}\n                href=\"https://anchor.fm/unswwit/episodes/Episode-2-Careers-Deep-Dive---Digital-Transformation-w-Shadiyah-Lim-ekak30\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              >\n                <img\n                  src={\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\n                    \"/blog-attachments/podcast-platforms/anchor-logo.jpg\"\n                  }\n                  alt=\"Anchor\"\n                />\n              </a>\n              <a\n                className={styles.innerBox}\n                href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8zNTQxM2JkMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw/episode/NTIwMDU5N2YtMjg5NC00ZjEwLWE2NTItMWRiMDc4ZGU0Njc5?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwigtazP_szsAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              >\n                <img\n                  src={\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\n                    \"/blog-attachments/podcast-platforms/google-podcasts-logo.jpg\"\n                  }\n                  alt=\"Google Podcasts\"\n                />\n              </a>\n              <a\n                className={styles.innerBox}\n                href=\"https://radiopublic.com/talk-wit-us-Ww3A3m/s1!284a5\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              >\n                <img\n                  src={\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\n                    \"/blog-attachments/podcast-platforms/radiopublic-logo.jpg\"\n                  }\n                  alt=\"RadioPublic\"\n                />\n              </a>\n              <a\n                className={styles.innerBox}\n                href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HAs2EMlXumfQzoaGMUpV8?si=isyEiUXwTBCqg5gLDwQiOg\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              >\n                <img\n                  src={\n                    process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\n                    \"/blog-attachments/podcast-platforms/spotify-logo.jpg\"\n                  }\n                  alt=\"Spotify\"\n                />\n              </a>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"angenie-bai\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/angenie-bai.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Angenie Bai\",\n              \"Externals Team\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost34;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost35 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #35\" />\n\n        {/*End of Header*/}\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\n              Introducing: Calista Kusuma, Information Systems and Marketing\n              Student\n            </h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>October 28, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Calista Kusuma is a Marketing and Information Systems student at\n              UNSW, passionate about finding new opportunities to grow and\n              making an impact with those opportunities.

But I'd always been\n              fascinated by technology, its ever-evolving nature and how it\n              disrupts the modern business landscape. This led me to take\n              INFS1602 and INFS1603 in first year, which sparked the idea of\n              pursuing an information systems degree with commerce. After some\n              research, I became increasingly attracted to interesting subjects\n              like mobile app development, and the wide career opportunities\n              that information systems offered. I also felt it would be a unique\n              match with my Marketing major- I wanted variety in my studies, and\n              to build a wide range of technical and soft skill sets so that I\n              could explore different fields as I figured out what I wanted in a\n              career. So, I chose to change to a Commerce and Information\n              Systems degree to explore my curiosities in-depth.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The differences between information systems and marketing are\n              exactly what has made studying them together so enjoyable - I can\n              be coding in one tutorial and researching Adidas' brand strategy\n              the next! I've also been able to explore many industries due to\n              the diversity and transferability of the skills I've developed.\n              I've completed development programs with great firms like\n              McKinsey, BCG and Bloomberg, and jobs and projects in areas from\n              technology consulting, marketing to even analytical journalism. My\n              majors always come up at interviews and networking events, and\n              I've gotten positive feedback on the range of skills learnt in the\n              pairing- especially how learning information systems is a great\n              choice in an increasingly digitized world.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Overall, my information systems degree has enabled me to be well\n              equipped for a tech-driven future, develop strong technical acumen\n              through skills like Java and business analysis, and explore a\n              range of career fields.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What skills do you think are important to continue to develop for\n              your future career?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I feel that self-motivation is an essential skill that sets people\n              apart - no matter what career or industry you're in. YOU are the\n              only person who can define your career and it's up to you seek out\n              and put effort into achieving your ambitions. Everyone has times\n              of self-doubt where they feel that their dreams are out of reach,\n              but what sets people apart is whether they can overcome these\n              thoughts to achieve their goals! By having a self-starter\n              attitude, you'll empower yourself to remain driven in the face of\n              setbacks and be able to recognize opportunity intuitively. It's\n              also valuable to employers who are always looking for proactive\n              candidates.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The ability to adapt to new situations, work under pressure and\n              problem solve are also important skills. The business landscape is\n              constantly changing, which means that you need to be prepared for\n              unfamiliar business problems that you can't Google the answers to\n              (sadly). Having these skills will allow you to embrace and rise\n              above challenges at work and your career- facing times of stress\n              with resilience to deliver strong results. You can grow these\n              skills in many ways throughout uni- joining societies in\n              subcommittee or executive positions. It is particularly great in\n              growing your ability to meet deadlines under pressure and adapt to\n              unexpected circumstances.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Finally, I think having some technological acumen is important in\n              an increasingly digitized world. Whether this means having a\n              technical skill like Java or Python, or being able to understand\n              concepts like blockchain. Technological change has become a\n              constant, and it's important to be aware of relevant trends and\n              innovations for your industry.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What are some of the technical skills you learned in your\n              information system degree?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              SQL was the first language that I learnt in the degree. It stands\n              for Structured Query Language and is the primary language used to\n              interact with relational databases. SQL is in high-demand within\n              all industries in an increasingly data-driven world- it's critical\n              in enabling us to access and manage data. This in turn enables the\n              user to create meaningful insights from the extracted data. For\n              example, I've talked to marketers who have used SQL to capture\n              customer data and actions, from which they can easily analyze\n              things like target market demographics and the effectiveness of an\n              advertising campaign.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Java is another key language that you learn. Java is a programming\n              language that is intended to let app developers 'write once, run\n              anywhere'. You use Java to build so many things- from mobile,\n              desktop and web apps to video games. I love how there is an\n              infinite amount of possibilities as to what you can create, and\n              it's a great one to learn if you're considering a path in\n              innovation.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"georgie-mansfield\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/georgie.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Georgie Mansfield\",\n              \"Education Team\",\n            ],\n            \"elisa-sanjurjo\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/elisa.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Elisa Sanjurjo\",\n              \"Education team\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost35;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost36 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #36\" />\n\n        {/*End of Header*/}\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\n              The Small, the Powerful…The Byte\n            </h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>November 1, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The byte.

It is\n              from the 8-bit byte that computers can produce letters, numbers,\n              or symbols. One byte has up to 28 or 256 different combinations,\n              that form the hundreds of possibilities of technology and hold\n              even more data and information that we experience and use in\n              everyday life.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.question}>So why 8 bits?</p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Funnily enough, early computer systems did attempt to use 5-bit\n              code, giving a mere 32 possible combinations, which was practical\n              if you only wanted lowercase letters of the English alphabet and a\n              few symbols. Unsurprisingly, this did not suffice. Trying to keep\n              it as minimal as possible, the 6-bit byte was then implemented and\n              used in a variety of IBM technologies, and with 26 or 64\n              possibilities, uppercase and lowercase letters with more symbols.\n              But still, limitations urged the development of more, and though a\n              7-bit byte was considered adequate (and is still used for Unicode\n              character sets), in 1970 the Intel 8080 became the first\n              widely-accepted 8-bit microprocessor.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.question}>The Small, the Powerful</p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              There’s a deep history and amazing complexity surrounding the\n              byte, much more than we can express here.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              But it’s not just that the byte is important, that it’s used\n              everyday in our lives, that it makes social media, typing, and\n              even pictures possible… but it’s that{\" \"}\n              <em>we can be like the byte.</em>\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                  A byte is tiny, yet essential.

My teacher could see how much I loved the\n              subject and challenged me to start learning how to code. It was\n              very simple and early stages of learning how to program but the\n              level of analytical and logical thinking really interested me. I\n              always knew that I loved Mathematics as well so I was naturally\n              inclined to Engineering. The more I learnt to code and about the\n              technological industry, I knew I wanted to keep learning in this\n              field and that is how I joined the STEM field as a Software\n              Engineer.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I started my career in Technology at a very young age. I was 15\n              when I secured an Internship at Google. I worked tirelessly to get\n              this role and I was driven to make a difference for other\n              students. At 16, I worked at a tech platform that connected\n              industries to students. The company secured a $1 million\n              investment. I didn’t want to stop. I wanted to make a difference.\n              My passion to be a leader in the IT industry landed me a role as a\n              Technical Specialist at Apple, making me one of the youngest. I\n              became one of the first Women to be awarded an Engineering\n              Scholarship at the University of Technology Sydney for a Bachelor\n              of Software Engineering (Honours) with a Diploma of Professional\n              Engineering Practice. Till now, I have had the opportunity to work\n              in different companies such as Apple, Cuscal, CSIRO and WiseTech\n              Global. I have always been proactively involved in roles that will\n              allow me to implement significant changes in current practices\n              within the company or in the technology they use.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              My drive is to make an impact and create ripples of change around\n              me. I have always been passionate about sharing my personal story\n              to encourage other students that no matter what age, you can\n              achieve your dreams. In the future, I see myself being a leader in\n              my field and creating a vision. I want to be able to design a\n              sustainable lifestyle with technology in the developing countries\n              to truly increase the life quality and standard to the best of my\n              ability.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What do you love about your career now?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Too many things, but I will keep it short. What I love about my\n              career is that it is always changing and evolving into something\n              better. I love the idea of improving, whether that means personal\n              growth or even if it makes automating something small for more\n              effective and efficient results. I am grateful that I have a lot\n              of experience for my age and I love that I can keep aiming for\n              high and trying new opportunities and roles. Technology and STEM\n              related careers allow you to think big and outside the box. It is\n              not narrow. I love that even if I love coding now, I still have\n              the knowledge and ability to be in a non-technical role. The\n              skills are interchangeable and as a young person in the early\n              stages of their career, it really inspires me to keep pushing hard\n              and making the most of all opportunities.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Why do you think it is important to empower women and increase\n              their involvement in the STEM industry?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              This is so important! For so many years, women have been a\n              minority in the STEM Industry. There have been so many instances,\n              too many to count where I am the only woman in a meeting, in a\n              group assignment or in a lab. When you empower someone else, you\n              have no idea how you can change their life. You have the ability\n              to share your own experiences in the hope that they will take\n              something, even a little bit out of it and make progress towards\n              their goals. This is how we inspire others. By empowering other\n              women and by actively increasing involvement in the STEM industry,\n              we are creating ripples of goodness around us and breaking the\n              stereotypes in STEM careers. If we work towards this, there may be\n              a time when women do not feel inferior to take action.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I believe the hardest thing for me so far has been truly\n              understanding what I want to do in my career, and stepping away\n              from the pressure around me to specialise in certain technical\n              areas.

It also allowed me to meet\n              Maggie (eXsight’s Co-Founder) and introduced me to opportunities\n              and mentors that I would never otherwise have had access to.

Because of this barrier to understanding the true\n              problem, we were working on a product for over a year that we\n              later realised wasn’t even addressing the true issues people were\n              talking to us about. We’ve also learnt the importance of putting\n              yourself out there and learned that there are a lot of people out\n              there who really want to help small businesses - there’s a ‘give\n              back’ sort of mindset within the startup community where people\n              want to help each other out, and I really love that.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What was the biggest challenge you faced whilst developing eXsight\n              and how did you overcome it?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Probably having to drop our original idea in order to create\n              something new that solved the problem better. It was really hard\n              to put aside all the hard work we’d done and essentially start\n              from scratch, but it was essential if we wanted to actually create\n              something meaningful and helpful for people. Keeping the long term\n              benefits in mind, as well as our goals for ourselves and our\n              business, is what helped us make the decision to pivot.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What advice would you give to prospective students who wish to\n              start their own technology projects?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I would highly recommend reaching out to existing startups and\n              small businesses.

Use simple bullet points and hierarchy (have a main heading\n              and bullet point below the heading).

Although so many of us take\n              the opportunity to set a New Year’s resolution, almost 80% of us\n              also give up on that goal. But it’s not just New Year’s\n              resolutions that we give up on, it’s the regular “new term, new\n              me” that almost all of us have heard or said, the out-of-the-blue\n              determination to start exercising, eating better, working harder,\n              achieve something bigger and more exciting, that starts so slowly,\n              but then accelerates so rapidly to turn from an ambitious goal to\n              something we once wanted to do.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              If these new, big, and exciting goals we decide to embark on in\n              the blink of an eye are so easy for us to abandon, how do we\n              change this mindset? How do we change the 80% of New Year goals\n              failed into 80% of New Year goals achieved?\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              <strong>We have to treat our goals like soft toys.</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              As kids, we had a toy that we grew up with. We took our soft toy\n              to bed, to the shops, outside, in the rain, through the mud, it\n              was part of us. Likewise, the determination to achieve our goals\n              need to become part of us too, something that we notice has an\n              impact in our daily lives no matter how specific the goal is.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              We loved the soft toy. We brushed it, dressed it, and played with\n              it. We had an emotional connection with our soft toy, and likewise\n              we should with our goals. The emotional connection to goals gives\n              us the drive and motivation to achieve them, as well as\n              emphasising the personal gain we get from them. The emotional\n              connection can be as simple as the visualisation of how proud you\n              will be when you achieve the goal, all the way to the\n              visualisation that the achievement of the goal will have great\n              impacts upon your everyday life.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Then trouble strikes with our soft toy. We get sick and have to\n              wash it, the toy gets torn, the toy is lost or ruined. Equally,\n              our goals are like this, achieving ambitious goals is difficult to\n              do, and whether it’s the simplicity in washing your dirty soft\n              toy, or the tiring and frustrating search of finding the toy you\n              lost, you will find a solution to the challenges and know that it\n              will be ok.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              However, we may also lose the toy all together. It’s a devastating\n              but also natural part of goal setting that sometimes they just\n              don’t work out. But just as we overcame losing our soft toy as a\n              child, we will overcome the goal that didn’t work out too.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Eventually, our parting moment comes. We grow out of our soft\n              toys, we become a big kid, lose the emotional connection, and\n              begin looking for bigger and more mature things to do. Likewise,\n              we grow out of the old goals we set for ourselves, the big goals\n              we set will soon be the ones we achieved, and allow us to set\n              bigger, more challenging goals that grow and change as we do.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The story of our soft toys through childhood ends here. However,\n              the memory still remains, we might not have our childish soft toy\n              anymore, or the comfort of something soft when we have a bad\n              dream, but we will always remember how much fun we had with our\n              soft toy, no matter how old we are.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Our goals can be career-driven, set on self-improvement, or simply\n              setting random fun challenges you want to do that year. Whatever\n              our goal is we must find the fun and excitement in working for\n              them so that when we look back on how far we’ve come we can smile\n              knowing that it was hard work but worth every moment.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              That brings us to this year. We might neglect another New Year’s\n              resolution, we might realise it wasn’t that fun, exciting, or\n              impactful. So let’s set our next goals to do precisely that, set\n              our next goals to be part of us, to have an emotional connection\n              to us, to sit through the rollercoaster of only sometimes knowing\n              if we will get through the challenges, setting bigger goals than\n              we did before, and finding the fun.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              <em>Our goals are like soft toys.</em> The excitement, challenge,\n              parting, and growth.

This sparked my interest to study\n              chemistry and understand the nature of chemical reactions.

Working in a start-up environment means that we work\n              with limited resources and upskill where we can.

The process of discovery is a wonderful journey\n              but one will always face setbacks.

This would help rapid construction in disaster-stricken\n              zones, in space or in unpredictable environments like at sea or\n              inside an underground cave.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              There are a lot of lessons from biology, such as construction\n              algorithms based on ant and termite colonies, or communication\n              algorithms based on bees. As I started this very early in my first\n              year, I pretty much had to parallely teach myself all the concepts\n              I needed as I started learning about them at uni. This made for an\n              interesting journey, as I found myself immediately applying what I\n              was learning, making the uni experience way more meaningful and\n              exciting for me.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              In what ways did your research project help you learn and grow as\n              a person?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              At my interview, my boss was an incredibly inspiring woman and\n              made a genuine connection with me. When I found out I had been\n              selected, she and I grew a close bond. She was always firm and had\n              high standards, and that pushed me to work really hard. She gave\n              me personal advice about how to deal with the stress of male\n              colleagues in the workplace, and how to position myself for\n              post-graduate courses. By giving me that first chance, she set me\n              on a whole new trajectory.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              With a change of leadership and numerous changes to the project\n              specification, I learnt the importance of adapting to continuously\n              changing circumstances. I learnt how to fail, and do so\n              gracefully. When you can’t meet a deadline, real life isn’t as\n              simple as a pass or fail. Research has to move on, you just dust\n              yourself off, make a report outlining how you plan to avoid what\n              happened, and move on!\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What was your biggest transformation since beginning your project?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I still remember the first time I walked past the Makerspace. I\n              was a shiny new first year, pumped up to get my hands dirty and do\n              all the engineering things I was promised. I was equally daunted\n              by the much taller, much buffer boys and some women in the space\n              handling the drills, saws and hammers with such ease and\n              authority. Having never even seen a laser cutter or 3D printer in\n              my high school, the Makerspaces seemed like an unreal, distant\n              dream.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Fast forward to now. Every second computer in three makerspaces\n              has my email logged in from when I sent myself a random Rhino file\n              to laser cut. All my clothes are stuffed into three drawers, and\n              my closet is filled with sheets of plywood, acrylic and 3mm\n              aluminium for my personal projects.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What is your best piece of advice?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              You tend to get a lot of advice about your career, a lot of it\n              unsolicited or from people who haven’t really done what they\n              wanted to do either. There isn’t a ‘right’ time to start working\n              on your career. As soon as you get to uni, you are in a perfect\n              twilight zone. You are recognised as an adult, get given paid\n              opportunities and have access to tools, equipment and resources\n              that high schoolers could only dream of. At the same time, you are\n              young enough for a lot of inexperience to be forgiven, and any\n              achievements you make are given a lot more credit than they would\n              in 10 years. Use that!\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Think about what interests you within your degree. Look up what\n              professors are working in that field. Write to some of them\n              checking if they are looking for or can make a place for interns.\n              Keep an eye out on facebook pages like CREATE, MTRNSoc, WIT etc.\n              for internship advertisements. Check out VIP and ChallENG\n              projects. Visit a Makerspace and ask if they have any fun projects\n              you can get involved in. Look into small startups - they won’t pay\n              much but you will get a lot of unique experiences and they are\n              usually always looking for a hand!\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What is your best piece of advice?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I, as have a lot of women in STEM, suffered from imposter syndrome\n              throughout my university career. The opportunities you earn seem\n              to feel like you were just at the right place at the right time. I\n              was voted in to be the first female president of CREATE. As a\n              female leader, I constantly found myself second-guessing my\n              decisions.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I think the hardest part isn’t proving to others that you are\n              worth your mettle, it is proving that to yourself. I still\n              struggle with it sometimes. It helped me to find myself a mentor\n              network - people I personally thought were where I wanted to be.\n              This diverse group of inspiring people would get late night texts\n              from me, asking for advice, tips, feedback, etc. Their support and\n              encouragement fuelled me, as it was praise coming from people who\n              I genuinely thought were extremely talented and special, I could\n              trust it and feel like I deserved it.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Life as a female engineering student isn’t as hard as it used to\n              be, but there is a long way to go before it is a fully inclusive\n              space. But I think the most important step we can take to push it\n              along in the right direction is to first accept and be proud of\n              who we are and what we can be. It’s the only way everyone else\n              will see that too!\n            </p>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"georgie-mansfield\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/victoria.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Victoria Ruming\",\n              \"\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost43;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost44 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #44\" />\n        {/*End of Header*/}\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>The Only Constant is Change</h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>March 4, 2021</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What is your best piece of advice?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              If there is one lesson we can all take away from 2020, it's that\n              none of us have a crystal ball. We learnt first-hand that it’s\n              impossible to predict the challenges that lay ahead. In the words\n              of theGreek philosopher Heraclitus,\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent} style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n              <em>‘The only constant in life is change’.</em>\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              So, as students, how should we handle the changes and transitions\n              we will face? How do we prepare for our next steps in an uncertain\n              and ever-evolving world? What kind of attitude and skills will we\n              need to weather the storm and emerge victorious?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              To help answer these questions, we spoke to Zoe Ong, a fourth-year\n              Accounting and Information Systems at UNSW. Zoe’s journey so far\n              has brought her face-to-face with tough decisions, periods of\n              change and testing situations. Her achievements to date are as\n              impressive as they are inspiring, so we decided to ask her to take\n              us through her journey stage by stage to unlock her secrets.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              Let’s begin back in 2018 when you were studying a Business\n              Administration and Accountancy degree at the University of the\n              Philippines Diliman. What inspired you to make the move to\n              Australia and study Computer Science and Commerce?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I was really attracted by the opportunity to do a double degree in\n              Australia. I felt it was important to build my technical knowledge\n              while also retaining the business element of my degree.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Another reason for the move was the fact that I was born and\n              raised in the Philippines, where I was still firmly within my\n              comfort zone. I decided that I wanted to pursue a new experience\n              and see what I could accomplish if I were more independent in a\n              completely new environment. I liked the idea of the challenge and\n              seeing how I could grow through that experience.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              How would you describe your experience of moving to Sydney?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              It was obviously a culture shock and I did struggle at times. I\n              left behind a life that had taken so long to build in order to\n              start afresh in Sydney. That meant having to build a group of\n              friends I could trust and depend on, and establish myself all over\n              again. After the first few months, I definitely felt like I had\n              made a mistake. The way that university is structured is so\n              different here. In the Philippines, I was part of a small cohort\n              and we had plenty of overlapping classes. In Sydney, I soon\n              realised that I could meet someone in a tutorial and then never\n              speak to them again. As an introverted person, it takes a while\n              for me to build relationships with people, so only being able to\n              see one person once, or a handful of times, and having to quickly\n              establish that relationship and rapport was challenging for me.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              That said, the transition was also quite exciting with all of the\n              constant change. I felt a general sense of gratitude, to be able\n              to have this opportunity to experience these new things I would\n              never have been able to experience in the Philippines. Without\n              coming here, I wouldn't have been able to achieve all the things\n              that have helped me build my confidence and understand myself more\n              and realise what type of person I am. I wouldn’t have learned\n              these things if I were still sheltered in my comfort zone.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What extracurricular activities did you get involved in as a\n              first-year here, and what drove you towards choosing those\n              particular societies?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              In my first year, I joined the subcommittee of UNIT. I wanted to\n              join UNIT because, in the Philippines, I had joined a finance\n              society, which I loved, and so I wanted to get involved in\n              something similar.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I also joined Capital W,because I knew I wanted to be in business\n              and I admired a lot of female entrepreneurs. Having a society\n              dedicated to empowering women aligned with my values. I wanted to\n              be part of a community of women who were also interested in\n              business and shared similar aspirations.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              And finally, I joined the events subcommittee of the Alternative\n              Investment Society because I was especially interested in venture\n              capital and the startup space. I felt like it would help me, as a\n              future entrepreneur, understand how to get funding and how to\n              appeal to investors.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              How did these experiences change you as a person?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Having wanted to push myself outside of my comfort zone, I\n              realized that somehow all my choices in my first year were based\n              on what I had done in the past. I used to be in a finance society\n              in the Philippines, so I joined a finance society in Sydney. I\n              used to be on an events committee in high school, so I joined an\n              events subcommittee here.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Although I did move to Sydney because I wanted that change, I will\n              admit that when I first moved it was a struggle to have to handle\n              all of that change at once. So to keep myself from getting\n              completely overwhelmed, I did try to think about some of the\n              interests that I still had, and that I could kind of bring into my\n              new life to have an anchor, so I didn’t get swept away by all\n              these changes that were happening.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I think there’s a lesson in there, that you can continuously\n              change, grow and explore, without having to completely abandon\n              past versions of yourself. Some people think that in order to\n              truly feel like you’ve grown, you have to take on a completely new\n              role or do things that are completely different from things you’ve\n              done in the past. That's not necessarily true. I believe that if\n              you already know what you like doing, and that's part of who you\n              are, you can grow by building on it.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              This is vertical growth. I think this can be better than\n              horizontal growth, which is expanding all of your interests, but\n              not really building on any of them. That was something I was quite\n              concerned about in my first year as well. I tried very hard to\n              make sure I was growing vertically, instead of just trying out a\n              bunch of random things without any sense of direction. I don't\n              think you have to know exactly what you want but you need to have\n              a bit of a plan and a sense of where you're going. It’s perfectly\n              fine to head down one road and realise it’s not for you but you\n              should let your experiences strengthen your internal compass. Then\n              you know that when you move, you're moving forward.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What did you learn from your society roles and how did these help\n              you transition to your internships at L’Oreal and Deloitte?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I learned some technical skills from my society experiences, such\n              as website design, user experience, and SQL. This was beneficial\n              in terms of securing an internship as I could show an aptitude for\n              tech and an ability to learn. I think that’s more important than\n              being a technical ‘expert’ when it comes to internships.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Also, as a natural introvert working with a lot of talented people\n              and strong personalities, I also learned that if I wanted to make\n              an impact, I had to speak up and make sure my voice was heard.\n              When you’re in front of a client, your first impression can be\n              your last impression, so you have to step up and speak up, even if\n              it doesn’t come naturally.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I also learned that soft skills are critical. For example, at\n              Deloitte I had to ask clients a lot of questions, you really need\n              to focus and make sure you're paying attention and listen\n              actively. You need to be able to question the information they\n              give you and ask insightful questions to get the information that\n              you need. Strong verbal and written communication is crucial, too.\n              You can learn technical knowledge as you go along but developing\n              soft skills is key.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              How do you adapt to changes in life?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I just dive in, and learn and grow as I go along. I am very\n              contemplative but I try to act before I reach the point of\n              overthinking and analysis paralysis. You have to have grit and\n              approach changes with hope and optimism, especially when you have\n              a hard time adjusting at first. The right mindset is key.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Another important thing when dealing with change is a good support\n              system. Build and nurture your support system because it can be\n              the one constant when everything changes around you. A solid group\n              of friends and family will keep you grounded and help you cope\n              with constant change.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>Who inspires you?</p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I do admire people like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Warren Buffett.\n              However, what inspires me the most is thinking back on times when\n              I really wanted and pictured something and it ultimately happened\n              for me. That's really motivating, especially when there are times\n              when I'm still in the phase where I'm still trying to achieve\n              something I really want. When I think about what I have\n              accomplished and remember that I actually pictured these\n              achievements months, or even years before, I feel energised to\n              keep going and be even better than my past self. It’s important to\n              keep a level of gratitude though, and not take things for granted\n              when they do work out.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"georgie-mansfield\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/vivianw2021.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\n              \"Co-President\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost44;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost45 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #45\" />\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>Introducing Nicola Daaboul</h2>\r\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\r\n              <span className={styles.date}>March 10, 2021</span>\r\n              <span>\r\n                <ShareBtns />\r\n              </span>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Nicola Daaboul is a Principal Asset Management Consultant at\r\n              Assetic, where she uses Assetic’s unique software to manage public\r\n              works and infrastructure.

Examples of this include\n                bacteria, viruses, other microorganisms, or even pollen. The\n                antigen that the vaccine is protecting against is taken from an\n                original petri-dish culture (cultured meaning grown) and are\n                cultured in a large-scale lab where temperature, pH, oxygen\n                rate, sterility, and homogeneity (sameness) are constantly\n                measured and maintained. This culturing step can take anywhere\n                between 2 days – 3 months depending on the antigen being\n                cultured.\n              </p>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                The antigen is then purified and inactivated to stop it from\n                causing disease, but still enabling it to activate an immune\n                response when the vaccine has been administered.\n              </p>\n\n              <li className={styles.question}>Formulation</li>\n              <div className={styles.postContent}>\n                Next, the vaccine formula is determined, typically including:\n              </div>\n              <ul>\n                <li className={styles.postContent}>\n                  Stabilisers – to maintain the ingredients of the vaccine\n                </li>\n                <li className={styles.postContent}>\n                  Adjuvants – to assist in triggering an immune response\n                </li>\n                <li className={styles.postContent}>\n                  Preservatives – to prevent bacterial/fungal contamination\n                </li>\n                <li className={styles.postContent}>The inactivate antigen</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <li className={styles.question}>Filling</li>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                The vaccine formula is filled into vials or syringes from which\n                the vaccine will be administered, and closed with sterile\n                stoppers.

Through her 85 years (1914-2000), she was successful in\r\n              every discipline she was involved in. You may have seen her in\r\n              popular 1940s films, having appeared in over 30. However, she also\r\n              played a vital role co-inventing an early version of\r\n              frequency-hopping (method of transmitting radio signals).\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              From a young age, Hedy was intrigued with how technologies\r\n              functioned, although she undertook no formal education and\r\n              remained primarily self-taught. Whilst she pursued her acting\r\n              career initially, it was during a time of upheaval, World War II,\r\n              where her innovative contributions would help the U.S. military\r\n              and influence future inventions, notably WiFi as we know it.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Prompted by the urgency of World War II, Hedy’s idea was to\r\n              develop a device that stopped enemy ships from being able to block\r\n              torpedo guidance signals. Along with her neighbour George Athiel,\r\n              the idea was brought to life by building a device where the radio\r\n              transmitter and torpedo receiver jumped between frequencies\r\n              simultaneously, such that by the time an enemy ship could locate a\r\n              signal, the signal would have jumped to another frequency before\r\n              it could be blocked. The idea was initially rejected by the US\r\n              Navy, but in the mid-1950s was used to to develop sonobuoys,\r\n              devices that were dropped in water to detect submarines, and\r\n              further remains the basis of Bluetooth, and foundation of Wi-Fi.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              In the 1940s, women like Lamarr were often valued for their\r\n              beauty, not for their ability to think, invent, or create. Despite\r\n              her brilliance, Lamarr did not receive a cent from the US\r\n              military, nor the multi-billion-dollar industry her innovations\r\n              paved the way for. Her work went unpublicized by the media, and\r\n              unrecognised by the scientific community for decades.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Eventually, in 1997 Lamarr became the first woman to receive the\r\n              Invention Convention’s Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award -\r\n              the Oscar of the inventing world. In 2014, she was inducted\r\n              posthumously to the National Inventors Hall of Fame for her\r\n              frequency-hopping technology. Lamarr has now been dubbed “the\r\n              mother of Wi-Fi”, and numerous books and graphic novels have been\r\n              published to tell her story.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              With the string of accomplishments she achieved over her years, it\r\n              was indeed remarkable to witness such a renown, multitalented\r\n              figure like Hedy who demonstrated early stint with different\r\n              technological inventions and credible Hollywood recognitions.\r\n              Throughout her pathway to success, Hedy persistently strived to\r\n              contribute her innovation for good.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              In the public eye, she was often overlooked in her marvelous\r\n              intelligence but if there is an outstanding trait to commemorate\r\n              her value-added contributions, it would be the courageous drive to\r\n              chase after her passion in face of adversity. It is really\r\n              inspiring to resonate with her independent traits which serve as a\r\n              strong testament to “self empowerment” today.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"georgie-mansfield\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/georgie2021.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Georgie Mansfield\",\r\n              \"Education Executive\",\r\n            ],\r\n            \"chelsea-chaffey\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/chelsea-chaffey.png\",\r\n              styles.anonProfile,\r\n              \"Chelsea Chaffey\",\r\n              \"Education team\",\r\n            ],\r\n            \"natalie-leroy\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/natalie-leroy.png\",\r\n              styles.anonProfile,\r\n              \"Natalie Leroy\",\r\n              \"Education team\",\r\n            ],\r\n            \"erika-shi\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/erika-shi.png\",\r\n              styles.anonProfile,\r\n              \"Erika Shi\",\r\n              \"Education team\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost47;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost48 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #48\" />\n        {/*End of Header*/}\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\n              Industry Insight Series Featuring Gunjan Arora\n            </h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>March 21, 2021</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Today we’re talking with Gunjan Arora, who was a Senior Quality\n              Assurance Analyst at Nine Publishing, and finding out how and why\n              she chose a career in this area.

Post my\n              graduation, I joined an engineering institute as a lecturer and\n              taught computer programming in C and Java. Thereafter I started my\n              career as a software engineer and since then have held different\n              positions in large-scale programs in telecommunication,\n              e-commerce, and media domains.

My day starts with a\n              daily scrum meeting. This is the forum for everyone to report on\n              what they have done yesterday, what’s the plan for today, and are\n              there any issues hindering the work. My responsibility here is to\n              make sure that everyone on the team follows defined QA processes (\n              peer-testing , peer-reviews etc). Post standup, I continue with my\n              assigned tickets, primarily related to writing automation scripts.\n              In addition to the above, and based on the project or sprints\n              requirement, I develop test strategies, test plans, grooming\n              tickets, organizing and facilitating bug bash, improving QA\n              processes, maintaining existing tests and frameworks, etc.\n              Basically, I try to simplify and innovate wherever we can.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What made you want to pursue a career as a Quality Analyst after\n              graduation?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              After graduation, when I joined the IT company I stumbled into a\n              testing project and from there my career as a Quality Engineer\n              started. Soon I realized that QA is a vital part of software\n              development and adds a lot of value to the business, hence I\n              decided to pursue it as my career. To get a better understanding\n              of the concepts, I did a certification which helped me understand\n              the fundamentals.

No matter what product you’re working\n              on, you are making people’s lives better by reducing the problems\n              they have to deal with in their day.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What’s the most challenging aspect of your role?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              As the fine lines between different roles within a Tech Company\n              are diminishing and the Quality Assurance roles are changing and\n              moving to Quality assistance roles, It's very important and\n              challenging to keep evolving and to keep improving the skill-set.\n              With Continuous Integration and Delivery, the whole landscape of\n              Tech development has changed mandating continuous testing for\n              faster feedback.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Another challenging aspect of a Quality Analyst Role is to bring a\n              balance between critical thinking and creative thinking. Being\n              critical helps you to look at software with a different\n              perspective, to question assumptions/ software behaviors whereas\n              creative thinking is important to bring innovation to the way you\n              work.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What are skills (both technical and soft) you advise students to\n              upskill on?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Being a student is the best time to explore the subjects that\n              really interest you and don’t be afraid to dive deep and get your\n              hands dirty. This will provide practical experience giving you an\n              edge during the interviews. Always be humble and curious to learn\n              as it will not only help to learn from others but will provide you\n              with ways to do your job better.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              You can never over-invest in communication skills because you will\n              need to express ideas and share information with your colleagues\n              and stakeholders. Equally important are listening skills as it\n              helps in creating trust, relationships, and help in getting an\n              understanding of a different perspective.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              How did you get started in this field and how well did your work\n              relate to the experience and studies that you had in university?\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I did my graduation in Computers Engineering which provided me\n              with much needed knowledge in software fundamentals to start my\n              career within the IT space. Based on my graduation background, I\n              applied for software engineering positions in different IT\n              companies and got selected in one of them. Being a newbie in the\n              professional IT world, I had to refresh my fundamentals on\n              software testing and revisited various concepts time and again. I\n              was also supported by the company and colleagues with training and\n              courses.

Sometime after that, I was a student\r\n              at Girls' Programming Network, where being surrounded by so many\r\n              awesome people and role models made me decide to pursue a career\r\n              in IT.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I was lucky enough to learn how to code in Python during high\r\n              school and found myself really enjoying the challenge of learning\r\n              programming. Then, attending the NCSS camp at the start of Year 11\r\n              pushed me to learn more about web development and programming.\r\n              Now, I'm currently studying IT at UTS, volunteering as Vice\r\n              President of the UTS Tech Society, and working as a software\r\n              engineer at Wisetech Global at the same time.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Definitely in a role where I'm coding a lot. I want to learn and\r\n              get comfortable in as many web development frameworks and\r\n              technologies as possible, so I hope to have the opportunity to try\r\n              working with all sorts of different technologies.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What do you love about your career now?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I feel like in IT and especially in web-related areas of IT,\r\n              there's no way one can know everything there is to know about\r\n              coding, whether it's different languages, frameworks, or even\r\n              design patterns, etc. so I find myself learning something new\r\n              quite frequently and constantly levelling up my knowledge on how\r\n              to implement functionality in elegant ways.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Why do you think it is important to empower women and increase\r\n              their involvement in the STEM industry?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The way I see it is that anyone can code and should have the\r\n              opportunity to learn. Anyone can learn the basics of code, be\r\n              creative and make something cool with code, and that shouldn't be\r\n              a thing that's introduced mainly to one gender early on. The more\r\n              women and non-binary people in the STEM industry, the more role\r\n              models there are to prove to girls and non-binary kids that they\r\n              can thrive in STEM as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              It's the other side of my favourite part of my career: the\r\n              inability to know everything. I'm often confused and stumped when\r\n              trying to develop a good way to code something, which is easily\r\n              the most frustrating thing about my career. Luckily, though, the\r\n              STEM industry is chock full of resources and people willing to\r\n              help us to learn from each other's roadblocks and discoveries.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your\r\n              career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I've seen other women hit a stressful point in a project and power\r\n              through to complete it. There have been mentors I've strived to\r\n              impress, friends I've admired for their strength in dealing with\r\n              stressful situations in a team, whether it's putting a cheerful\r\n              face on and directing others through the roadblock or\r\n              communicating that they need a break and want help from others to\r\n              take over. There's even been a point in time where I saw one of my\r\n              mentors swear at the code for not working, and I thought, \"Wow, I\r\n              want to become as confident in my skills as her so I can swear at\r\n              the program instead of doubting myself.\"\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the hard and soft skills that you would advise students\r\n              who are interested in pursuing a similar career path to upskill\r\n              on?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The most important hard skill is the understanding of coding\r\n              fundamentals that every language has.

For me, it's because\r\n              I'm stubborn, but it gets to a point where you're searching and\r\n              searching, and it turns out you just needed another pair of eyes\r\n              on the problem. The ability to communicate your problem and\r\n              explain what you know and what you're stuck on is super useful as\r\n              well- heck, you might even realise the solution as you're\r\n              explaining it to someone else.{\" \"}\r\n              <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"happy face\">\r\n                😆\r\n              </span>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What is one piece of advice that you would give to your younger\r\n              self back in university?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I'm still studying at uni, so this will be towards my first-year\r\n              self, I guess: Take your time when learning something new.

One method is to\n              utilise CO2 as a feedstock for fuel production. My PhD research\n              focused on the engineering of nickel catalysts for carbon dioxide\n              hydrogenation to methane. The reaction aims to promote process\n              sustainability by occurring under photothermal conditions,\n              dependent on the light-to-heat conversion. Similar to most\n              chemical reactions, a catalyst is needed for the reaction. The\n              scope of my work involved probing the impact of catalyst support\n              properties, separating the effects of light and heat in the\n              reaction, and understanding the role of defects in the catalyst.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What are the limitations of your research?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Relative to other conditions of CO2 conversion to methane,\n              photothermal conditions and the number of catalysts tested have\n              not been probed as extensively. Therefore, there are limitations\n              in terms of understanding such as on the catalyst properties that\n              influence the reaction.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What inspired you to explore your research topic?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Prior to my PhD studies, my research project during the MEng\n              programme (at the University of Sheffield) also involved utilising\n              CO2 as a building block. I found the concept to be very\n              interesting because it involved producing a valuable product from\n              something that would have essentially become ‘waste’. I was drawn\n              by the sustainability aspect of the process and how it addresses\n              the current environmental issues.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What challenges/conflicts have you faced in your studies or your\n              research?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              There’s a lot of new skills to learn and responsibilities to\n              undertake, which can be challenging at first. However, it’s just a\n              matter of working through it and over time, new concepts would be\n              easier to grasp. Challenges can also be a source of motivation,\n              such as when testing a new material and anticipating the result.\n              Some experiments take several hours or days, and waiting to\n              observe the outcome is very exciting.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What skills are most important in order to successfully complete a\n              research project?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              In my experience, the skills I found important were time\n              management, perseverance, patience, creativity, and communication.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              What piece of advice would you give your younger self?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I would say that my experience at the beginning of my PhD\n              programme was a steep learning curve. There was a lot to learn,\n              process, and skills to acquire. I think that the advice I would\n              give to my younger self would be to be patient with myself, always\n              be proactive in seeking resolution, and the importance of a\n              supportive network. Guidance and support from attentive\n              supervisors also have a strong influence on the experience.\n              Additionally, I frequently talk through my ideas and challenges\n              with friends, who were great at listening and help process my\n              thoughts. It is equally important for me to be present and\n              supportive.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I would also tell myself to find a hobby or learn new skills.

Based on my experience, when I was an undergrad\n              student, I knew that I wanted to do a PhD degree after graduation\n              and so I was keen to do research placements during my university\n              breaks. Finding a placement definitely takes time and motivation.\n              As I was looking for work experience in Australia while I was in\n              England, I started almost one year prior to find a placement. I\n              was very fortunate to have gained research experience at the\n              Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation\n              (CSIRO) in Melbourne and with PARTCAT at UNSW during the summer\n              after Year 2 and 3, respectively. The experience from both places\n              were invaluable and I am incredibly grateful to my supervisors and\n              colleagues.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>\n              In your opinion, what are the most important skills needed in the\n              workforce?\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              I would say that the important skills are honesty, time\n              management, critical thinking, and communication. My PhD studies\n              was definitely a time that I’ve acquired many technical skills and\n              new understanding, which are transferable to the workforce.

Being as tedious a calculation as it sounds, combined with a\r\n              shortage of engineers, approximately 100 women in the US were\r\n              hired to perform this task. Their job title? “Computer”.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              As WW2 progressed, the need for important calculations such as\r\n              missile trajectories quickly grew, and thus, the Electronic\r\n              Numerical Integrator and Computer or ENIAC was built.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              After the building of ENIAC was completed, the AI computer needed\r\n              to be programmed to actually perform the calculations required. To\r\n              do this, 6 women, Jean Jennings, Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman,\r\n              Betty Snyder, Frances Bilas, and Kay McNulty from the Computers\r\n              were selected to the milestone project - programming the ENIAC.\r\n              These women were given 3 months of intensive training on how to\r\n              handle some of the IBM machines being used at the time, after\r\n              which they were given a pile of wiring diagrams and as Kay Mauchly\r\n              (nee. McNulty) recalls, they were simply told to “figure out how\r\n              the machine works, and then figure out how to program it.” After\r\n              an intense effort of hand-wiring, switches, cables, and\r\n              differential equations, the programming of the ENIAC, and world’s\r\n              first computer program was finally completed.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent} style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\r\n              <b>\r\n                <em>\r\n                  “We were sure this machine could do anything we wanted it to\r\n                  do.” – Marlyn Wescoff\r\n                </em>\r\n              </b>\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The legacy left by these women is astounding, and although their\r\n              work was not completed in time for the war effort, it paved the\r\n              way for calculations, computing, and programming today. Not only\r\n              that, but the effort of these women and many other female pioneers\r\n              in computer science such as Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper\r\n              highlight the elemental role women have played in creating\r\n              computing and founding the discipline as we know it today. The\r\n              programming of the ENIAC also introduced some of the earliest\r\n              forms of artificial intelligence, where a job previously taking\r\n              over 40 hours for a person to complete, could be undertaken in\r\n              less than a second by the AI computer, the ENIAC.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              While the effort and ground-breaking work undertaken by the women\r\n              of ENIAC was so essential, their names quickly became lost in\r\n              history, until an undergraduate computer science student, Kathy\r\n              Kleiman, began searching for a female role model in a degree where\r\n              she was surrounded by males. She came across an image of the women\r\n              of ENIAC working on the computer and was astounded by the\r\n              confidence of these women as they handled the complex machine. The\r\n              confidence of these women remains empowering for women in STEM\r\n              today. The task was difficult, it was brand new to the women of\r\n              ENIAC, and required a rapid learning of skills that paved the way\r\n              for technology everywhere, creating confidence amongst these women\r\n              that “this machine could do anything we wanted it to.” In a world\r\n              where sometimes our effort feels useless, this mindset of\r\n              confidence is important for all of us in our work. It can\r\n              encourage us to take on challenges, to push ourselves, to have a\r\n              willingness to learn new things, and to take on the unknown.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The Women of ENIAC have left a remarkable legacy for all computer\r\n              science students, the founding efforts of an essential discipline,\r\n              a willingness to learn, excitement of taking on challenges,\r\n              pushing themselves, working together, and a lesson of confidence\r\n              in their work to all.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"georgie-mansfield\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/georgie2021.jpg\",\r\n              styles.authorProfile,\r\n              \"Georgie Mansfield\",\r\n              \"Education Executive\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost51;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost52 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #52\" />\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>The Quantum Computing Race</h2>\r\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\r\n              <span className={styles.date}>April 13, 2021</span>\r\n              <span>\r\n                <ShareBtns />\r\n              </span>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Computers are complex, intricate machines capable of solving many\r\n              human challenges. Through computer science, we transform simple on\r\n              and off switches into systems that store and manipulate\r\n              information. However, they come down to one thing: millions and\r\n              billions of bits*. To make classical computers faster, and better,\r\n              we can do two things: make more bits, or make our bits smaller.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              However, we’re fast approaching a hard limit: the size of an atom\r\n              itself. The smaller we make our transistors (electrical switches),\r\n              the closer we get to quantum physics - a subatomic netherworld\r\n              where our normal assumptions about space and time no longer make\r\n              sense. If we make our transistors too small, electrons may\r\n              ‘quantum tunnel’, that is, teleport to the other side - as if the\r\n              barrier did not exist at all. But if classical computing fails,\r\n              why not make radically different computers based upon quantum\r\n              physics itself?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              What exactly is quantum physics about? It describes the behaviour\r\n              of tiny particles, from molecules to electrons to photons. Quantum\r\n              particles behave and interact like waves, but when we measure\r\n              them, they look like points - which allows for some very\r\n              interesting observations.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Firstly, according to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, it is\r\n              impossible to know precisely where anything is nor how fast it\r\n              moves. Everything happens on a probability curve for its location\r\n              - which means an electron in my dinner has a high probability of\r\n              being in my dinner, and a very low probability of being on Mars -\r\n              but theoretically it could still be found on Mars.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Secondly, you may have heard of Schrödinger's cat - a famous\r\n              analogy describing the mind bending paradox of quantum\r\n              superposition. We have a cat, some cat food and a radioactive\r\n              chemical in a closed box. At some unknown time the radioactive\r\n              chemical will poison the cat's food, causing the poor cat to\r\n              perish. From a quantum perspective, this cat is neither alive nor\r\n              dead - it is simultaneously both at the same time. The cat's\r\n              mortality is entirely undetermined until we open the box and look\r\n              inside.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Introducing quantum computing. Instead of bits we have quantum\r\n              ‘qubits’, where we, for example, decide a clockwise spin is ‘1’\r\n              and an anticlockwise spin is ‘0’. But like Schrödinger's cat,\r\n              quantums can also exist in superposition - they might have a 70%\r\n              probability of spinning clockwise, and a 30% chance of spinning\r\n              anticlockwise. This isn’t a limitation of our knowledge or our\r\n              measuring equipment, it's a fundamental tenet of how our universe\r\n              works - randomness.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              If 1 qubit can have 2 values simultaneously, then 4 qubits can\r\n              store 16 values, and 16 qubits can store 65536 values. This means\r\n              we multiply the amount of information we manipulate, with just one\r\n              caveat - we can only read a tiny subset of this information at\r\n              once.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Regardless, we can take advantage of this probabilistic behaviour\r\n              to do interesting, and possibly dangerous, computations. Modern\r\n              cybersecurity relies on the difficulty of factoring huge numbers,\r\n              a mammoth task that takes modern supercomputers millions of years\r\n              to solve. However, a quantum computer might use its own wave\r\n              interference to cancel out invalid factorisations, cracking codes\r\n              including 128-bit AES encryption in mere seconds. On the other\r\n              hand, the new field of quantum cryptography could rely on the\r\n              physics laws of uncertainty, becoming truly unbreakable.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              A quantum computer could model molecules and chemical reactions to\r\n              exceptional detail, providing biological insights that might\r\n              identify the next medical breakthrough. We could simulate complex\r\n              systems from climate change to financial markets, with the new\r\n              knowledge helping us build a more sustainable future. With\r\n              Grover’s Algorithm, quantum computers could search databases in a\r\n              fraction of the time, allowing us to analyse greater amounts of\r\n              data.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              But why are quantum computers so difficult to create? Qubits are\r\n              fragile, unstable: their states change in fractions of a second,\r\n              and any external noise will distort them. Researchers can’t even\r\n              read qubit values without ‘collapsing’ their states, making it\r\n              equivalent to finding errors blindfolded. Even more worryingly,\r\n              it’s theoretically impossible to copy a quantum particle without\r\n              altering the original, making any ‘clone and compare’ correction\r\n              method impossible.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              So how have scientists and engineers tackled these challenges so\r\n              far? One method involves storing tiny loops of superconducting\r\n              metal near absolute zero - colder than outer space. Magnetic\r\n              shields protect these qubits from thermal noise, and microwaves\r\n              manipulate the behaviour within.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Both Google and IBM are racing to develop this technology. In 2019\r\n              Google claimed they achieved ‘quantum supremacy’ with their\r\n              53-qubit Sycamore machine, which solved in 200 seconds a problem\r\n              that would reportedly take IBM’s supercomputer 10,000 years.\r\n              However, this has been disputed by IBM physicists, which claim\r\n              their computer would take only 2.5 days with some clever\r\n              programming. On the other hand, IBM has promised to deliver a\r\n              1000-qubit computer by 2023, an important milestone that would\r\n              have us well on our way to a machine capable of breaking internet\r\n              encryptions.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Even with supercooling, these techniques are imperfect, with\r\n              Google’s Sycamore machine reportedly producing 99% noise and only\r\n              1% signal. Furthermore, the huge costs involved are not feasible\r\n              for everyday machines. However, ORCA, a UK firm, recently\r\n              developed a promising approach to storing and entangling room\r\n              temperature photons - avoiding the need to build giant\r\n              liquid-helium refrigerators. Another popular method involves\r\n              placing doped atoms on a silicon chip to nanometre precision, such\r\n              that their quantum properties are heightened. In 2018, Prof\r\n              Michelle Simmons (UNSW) won Australian of the Year for leading\r\n              research in this area, creating a silicon quantum processing unit\r\n              that is 200 times faster than any before.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Controlling particles whose very existence is riddled with\r\n              uncertainty is a huge challenge for physicists and computer\r\n              scientists today.

They're all brilliant in their own\r\n              ways, yet so approachable and down-to-earth. There's banter and\r\n              there are people sharing their knowledge with each other (both\r\n              work-related and non-work related).

I felt like I didn't\r\n              belong like I wasn't the right kind of person to be pursuing this\r\n              career. It really wasn't until I met the Googler at the outreach\r\n              event that I felt I had a shot. It saddens me to think that so\r\n              many brilliant women have been or may still be in the position I\r\n              was in, but because they didn't have someone who believed in them\r\n              and empowered them they didn't pursue a STEM career. It is\r\n              important for those women to know that they do have a shot, that\r\n              they do belong, and that they are enough. It is important that\r\n              young girls see more women in STEM so they won't have that fear of\r\n              not belonging or not being the right kind of person for the job or\r\n              careers.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The most challenging part of my career has been dealing with\r\n              Impostor Syndrome, feeling like there must have been some mistake\r\n              in the hiring process and that I landed this job on luck. But\r\n              talking with my colleagues, mentors, and friends, it's something\r\n              that everyone goes through. Accepting that fact helped me realise\r\n              that we're all human and that we've all earned our place here, one\r\n              way or another.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your\r\n              career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The Googler that I met at the university outreach event inspired\r\n              me to become a person who gives people hope. I strongly believe\r\n              that there is no cookie-cutter personality that is perfect for a\r\n              job in STEM, and I take every chance I get to share the message of\r\n              \"you can\". I've had many conversations with classmates and young\r\n              students where their belief that \"they can't\" stops them from\r\n              trying. I want to give people the encouragement they need to take\r\n              that first step because that can be the hardest part.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the hard and soft skills that you would advise students\r\n              who are interested in pursuing a similar career path (for\r\n              internship/graduate role) to upskill on?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Knowing how to ask questions is a very important soft skill to\r\n              have. Because the problems in STEM can be so abstract and you'll\r\n              likely be thrown into a problem space you have little experience\r\n              with, knowing the best way to phrase a question and being\r\n              comfortable with asking questions can come in really handy.\r\n              Knowing the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms\r\n              and how they can be applied in various problem spaces is also very\r\n              handy. I can highly recommend having a personal project where you\r\n              find a problem that interests you (for me it was translating morse\r\n              code) and see how data structures and algorithms can be used to\r\n              solve it.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What is one piece of advice that you would give to your younger\r\n              self back in university?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Believe in yourself.

I\r\n              believe encouraging women in our society to not limit themselves\r\n              in terms of where they go or what they see themselves doing is\r\n              crucial.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The most challenging aspect for me is that there is so much more\r\n              that I don’t know. I think this is something that makes careers in\r\n              the STEM industry fascinating but also challenging. With the help\r\n              of my colleagues, I have learned that there will always be\r\n              something I don’t know and that’s okay.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your\r\n              career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I met a director at a consulting firm I interned at in my 3rd\r\n              year.

Her leadership style contradicted\r\n              what I believed to be effective before that internship and it\r\n              completely blew my mind that someone can be soft and affirmative\r\n              at the same time.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What are the hard and soft skills that you would advise students\r\n              who are interested in pursuing a similar career path (for\r\n              internship/graduate role) to upskill on?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              I would recommend upskilling on two skills – one that is relevant\r\n              to what you study and one that you have no knowledge of.

But\r\n              processes and products that have been around for thousands of\r\n              years, such as crop breeding and antibiotics, are also examples of\r\n              biotechnology.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Biochemical engineer and UNSW A/Prof Christopher Marquis, when\r\n              asked to summarise biotechnology, replied that it “takes our\r\n              understanding of cell biology and chemistry to create a range of\r\n              products and solutions to problems in medicine, food and energy.\r\n              We can think of fermented foods, antibiotics, vaccines and\r\n              biofuels as just a few of the biotechnology innovations that have\r\n              made enormous impacts on humanity.”\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Current applications and key fields of research\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Biotechnology is not a new discipline, but advances over the last\r\n              decade have led to more applications in our day-to-day lives, from\r\n              pharmaceutical development to food production and waste treatment.\r\n              Brand new areas of research include nanotechnology-enhanced\r\n              therapies, microalgae manipulation to produce biomolecules,\r\n              plastic-degrading enzymes, stem cell engineering, and wearable\r\n              biosensors for diagnostic purposes.The possibilities really are\r\n              endless!\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Many types of modern biotechnology rely on DNA technology.\r\n              Sequencing an entire genome is still a very complex task to\r\n              accomplish.

According to Chris Marquis, “With our rapidly\r\n              increasing capacity to understand cell biology through, for\r\n              example, genetic sequencing, biotechnology will play a key role in\r\n              providing sustainable improvements in health, agriculture and\r\n              environment for the 21st century.”\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>Why is biotech so important?</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Biotechnology is part of the current technology revolution; our\r\n              world is becoming increasingly digitised, and science cannot be\r\n              applied without technology and engineering.

More so than any other sense, our sense of smell is directly\r\n              linked to memory. Smell is processed in the area of our brains\r\n              that is directly connected to the amygdala, which contributes to\r\n              emotional memories. This is why sometimes, when we catch a whiff\r\n              of a specific scent, detailed memories or intense emotions can be\r\n              triggered.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Now a team of historians, chemists, perfumers, and specialists in\r\n              artificial intelligence have taken this concept to the next level,\r\n              utilising the power of AI in order to preserve the historic smells\r\n              of 16th to 20th century Europe, in a project dubbed “Odeuropa”.\r\n              Each distinct smell will have a labelled source, origin,\r\n              qualities, and significance in its respective time period,\r\n              collated as part of a huge online database, the Encyclopedia of\r\n              Smell Heritage.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>Why recreate ancient smells?</p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              According to the Odeuropa team, the project aims to “identify and\r\n              trace how ‘smell’ was expressed in different languages, with what\r\n              places it was associated, what kinds of events and practices it\r\n              characterised, and to what emotions it was linked”, thus\r\n              preserving the larger collective olfactory heritage of Europe.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Dr William Tullett, a history and smell expert from Anglia Ruskin\r\n              University says, “For me, tobacco is really an essential smell in\r\n              European history and heritage. It's a hot, smoky, pungent smell\r\n              but of course, it's not one smell at all, because perfumers and\r\n              tobacconists and grocers have experimented with scenting tobacco\r\n              in all kinds of ways. But as a historian, it's also interesting\r\n              for me because it links to histories of sociability, of trade and\r\n              colonisation and also health.”\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Smells like tobacco, among others, can reveal a lot about a time\r\n              period, not only in the obvious way - in how it smelt - but also\r\n              about the social climate of the time and the cultural\r\n              significance.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>A multidisciplinary project</p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The information documented in the Encyclopedia of Smell Heritage\r\n              would be used by chemists and perfumers to reconstruct and produce\r\n              a number of significant smells. These reconstructed odours would\r\n              then be displayed at museums and heritage sites, making the\r\n              exploration of European history more of an immersive multi-sensory\r\n              experience. In making the exploration and appreciation of history\r\n              more multidimensional, perhaps the smells recreated could evoke\r\n              untapped emotions within us.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              The Power of Artificial Intelligence\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The project will use AI algorithms to identify any mention or\r\n              descriptions of smells and fragrances across thousands of texts,\r\n              ranging from historical to scientific. The dataset is expected to\r\n              have over 4,000,000 texts and paintings, in seven different\r\n              languages - Latin, English, Italian, German, French, Dutch, and\r\n              Slovenian. As the AI is taught words, phrases, and expressions\r\n              relating to smells or describing the act of smelling, such as\r\n              “fragrance”, “odour”, “aroma”, “the scent of…”, feeding the\r\n              automatic learning algorithm, it can in turn search for, and\r\n              recognise any references to smell within texts.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Similarly, the AI would identify any aromatic elements within\r\n              artworks too. The algorithm would be fed image datasets with\r\n              scented elements, such as flowers or smoke, or images of noses “in\r\n              action” that are in the process of smelling something. It could\r\n              also be taught to recognise the facial expressions of figures\r\n              while smelling - and deduce whether the smells were pungent or\r\n              pleasant!\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              The process of training the machine learning software to recognise\r\n              references to smell in computer texts would take about 18 months,\r\n              according to project manager Marieke van Erp. By the end of it,\r\n              the learning software would be able to scan thousands of documents\r\n              and images and identify those smell descriptions by itself. By\r\n              utilising AI’s power to examine massive quantities of data at top\r\n              speeds, the project maximises the amount of information that can\r\n              be collated into the online encyclopedia of scents.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              In using AI algorithms to reconstruct elements of history, we can\r\n              see how artificial intelligence, a part of our future, is\r\n              recreating our past. In a way, as technology meets history, the\r\n              lines between the past and the future are blurred.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"therese-nguyen\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/therese-nguyen.png\",\r\n              styles.anonProfile,\r\n              \"Therese Nguyen\",\r\n              \"Education Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost57;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost58 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #58\" />\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\r\n              Introducing Melanie Dietrich, Data Analyst at Raisin & Co-Founder\r\n              of Women In Data x Business\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\r\n              <span className={styles.date}>June 16, 2021</span>\r\n              <span>\r\n                <ShareBtns />\r\n              </span>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Being both a Data Analyst at Raisin, a Berlin Fintech company and\r\n              Co-Founder of Women in Data x Business, Melanie Dietrich has\r\n              clearly demonstrated amazing qualities as a successful woman in\r\n              her STEM career as she strives for equal representation in gender\r\n              opportunities.

Technical skills have become a part of the hiring process where candidates are expected to possess a fundamental knowledge of IT in order to be granted workforce entry. Subsequently, the need for coding expertise has naturally increased across various industries to support their backend developments, and as such many programming job roles exist today from software developers to cloud engineers.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Going forward as an ‘IN’ topic, coding is here to stay in the long run and it will undoubtedly be set as one of the most vital skill sets required to thrive in a future of technological innovation.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Industry and Daily Outlook of Coding Applications \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Coding can be found almost everywhere in backend systems or software to power up supporting functionalities. Without coding, machines like computers and AI chatbots would become obsolete equipment that cannot be operated. Coding can also be seen as the embodiment of bringing technological products ‘alive’, providing installations of source codes to feed in a set of unique commands for them to execute accordingly. \r\n              <br /> \r\n              <br /> \r\n              Across various industries, many software applications are supported by strings of codes to efficiently perform their functionalities today.

In our personal lives, the activities that we do on our electronic devices: like searching up what Netflix show to binge-watch or ordering your favorite Uber food delivery or best of all, taking a selfie from your phone, all strings of codes behind them that are developed to allow you as an end-user to use their interfaces anytime, anywhere. \r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Sounds pretty interesting right?

This is a common misconception that a lot of us tend to subconsciously assume before taking the first steps into learning to code and resultantly, it creates a deterrence for those who are either not confident in their coding abilities or are wary of the technical difficulty levels expected to produce effective results, to shy away from their interests.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Debunking the coding myth above, <b><i>‘Coding is not an exclusive language’.</i></b> Its wide accessibility is meant to be welcoming and honestly, there is so much more to discover in coding beyond simply the logical flows of technical scripts. After all, the main identity factor towards finding “fun” in coding is the instant gratification of being able to experiment with your creative methods of approaching a case problem and implementing your programming codes to solve them. It connects you deeply to the longing of crafting your own innovative solution and the investment in producing something useful of your own!\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              However, at the same time, many people say coding is too hard and eventually give up and fail. For those trying to stay motivated while learning, don’t overlook the fact that coding processes can take a long time for programmers and developers too with many trials and errors to undergo in proof-checking to ensure all scripts are functioning with an accuracy rate close to 100%. \r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              It is normal to feel frustrated while learning. But ultimately, it is all part of the experimentation process and that’s the beauty of coding. You can enjoy the learning growth as you practice your coding skills, be challenged to solve real-world problems, and become a technical inventor yourself. Being able to see the ‘fun’ in coding will come naturally when you find joy in tackling challenges and are constantly driven to search for deep-rooted answers beneath the surface problem.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Future of Coding\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Technology is at the forefront of our future of innovation, sustainable developments, and personal convenience.

There are 21 million finite Bitcoins. However, with all this being said, Bitcoin (BTC) in most cases is overrated.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. To truly understand BTC, one must understand cryptocurrency and the technology behind it- blockchain.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Cryptocurrency explained \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Cryptocurrency is a digital exchange where the transactions are done through cryptography maintained by a decentralised system rather than a centralised authority. This means that there is not only one person or government as the owner but rather a collective. Likewise, with physical cash, the coins that are a part of cryptocurrency are essentially worthless but the ability they have, with making transactions, is what gives it worth. The currency is also nearly impossible to forge due to the technology that it is built on- blockchain.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Blockchain explained\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Blockchain is a system of recording information - a digital ledger of transactions that are duplicated and spread across an entire network of computers. If a change has been made as part of the blockchain, every computer in the network will update to reflect that modification. This technology is why it is hard to hack into blockchain.\r\n              <br /> \r\n              <br /> \r\n              The technology of blockchain will be used for several tasks such as reducing a large amount of paperwork and becoming the foundation of currencies in some countries. This can be seen with China’s government researching a potential blockchain-type currency, despite attempting to criminalise all other cryptocurrency exchanges. Companies and individuals have also turned to embrace blockchain, such as IBM investing over $200 million into research of the technology and Elon Musk having a great influence over the cryptocurrency market, as can be seen with Dogecoin. Musk’s company Tesla, is another notable example of this, owning hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC in its reserves.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br /> \r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Future of blockchain\r\n            </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              The future of blockchain is already taking shape with the ability to ensure the safety of public records, which will be more secure and resistant to corruption attempts. This can also remove the possibility of voter fraud and speculation, making online voting much more accessible and protected. The ability of storing data will not only help the government, but also those of the public with eliminating third-party interference that is often done by the bank with transacting currencies. Already, a platform called ‘Ecoinmerce’ has used blockchain to reduce 60% of the product price.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              There will also be ‘smart contracts’ which are basically real-life contracts but in the digital world stored in blockchain. This will transform the way people ‘sign’ contracts in a more efficient, accurate and transparent manner. Some currencies already support ‘smart contracts’ such as Ethereum, which was made for this very purpose. Bitcoin also has this application but is much more limited in its capabilities. All these pathways brought about by blockchain, will definitely change the future.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Why Bitcoin is overrated\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              As stated above, the technology behind cryptocurrency, has a lot of potential, however, BTC fails to effectively utilise blockchain’s abilities.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              The founding process of BTC is largely ambiguous, having an unknown inventor and being unable to trace the coin to its origins. In addition to this, the currency itself is slow to transfer from one electronic wallet to another, inflexible and very environmentally unfriendly due to the excessive use of electricity to mine the coin. \r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              In comparison to another form of cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH) for example, BTC cannot compete. ETH works at a much faster pace, is flexible and with a new update coming soon, it will become much more environmentally friendly. Although, it must be acknowledged that BTC is the ‘grandfather’ coin and thus started the trend for cryptocurrency.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              However, for now, if you choose to invest into Bitcoin – proceed with caution, as it you might find yourself with a large profit margin from trading or; you could be left with major losses wondering if the investment was worth it. With hundreds of coins on offer, one begs to question if Bitcoin is just overrated.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              A simple visual explanation of how cryptocurrency works: \r\n              <br />\r\n              <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6er6zc\" className={styles.link} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6er6zc</a>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"erika-shi\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/natalie-leroy.png\",\r\n              styles.anonProfile,\r\n              \"Natalie Leroy\",\r\n              \"Education Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost60;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost58 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #61\" />\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\r\n              Introducing Vivian Shen\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\r\n              <span className={styles.date}>June 30, 2021</span>\r\n              <span>\r\n                <ShareBtns />\r\n              </span>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={styles.post}>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              On course to graduate with a Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions, Vivian has\r\n              already amassed a great deal of awe-inspiring experience, having interned at Google \r\n              and Atlassian and leading UNSW Women in Technology as its President in 2020. \r\n              Currently working as a casual academic in UNSW’s Computer Science and \r\n              Engineering Faculty, Vivian shares her knowledge and expertise with her fellow \r\n              technology students.

In a world where we are constantly connected over the radio waves, the boundaries between everyday realities and online life become more blurred. Is reality simply a series of experiences - mere sight, smell, touch and thought - or is it something more? Does technology isolate us, or does it expand our horizons? \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n            At the moment, many of our daily online experiences are static: scrolling through social media, watching YouTube, listening to the radio. But one day, our virtual experiences may become indistinguishable from the real world. Putting on a simple headset could mean stepping into another country, another world, or another universe. This is not teleportation, nor is it a dream. It is Virtual Reality, and its foundations are already in our grasp.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              What is Virtual Reality?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Virtual Reality, or VR, is a simulated, 3D multisensory experience created by technology. Once in the realm of science fiction, the age of Virtual Reality began in 2010 when teenager Palmer Lucky duct-taped together what became the first prototype of the Oculus Rift.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Like novels, cinemas, and games, Virtual Reality has the ability to unlock alternate fantastical worlds. There’s no doubt that what makes VR so appealing is the promise of escaping our everyday worries. But while VR technologies such as Playstation VR, the HTC Vive, and the Oculus Rift have been a huge success in the gaming industry, its potential to revolutionize other parts of our world has been largely unexplored. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <br /> \r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.question}>\r\n              Where can Virtual Reality take us?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Virtual Reality could become a safe platform for training in high-risk professions. In careers such as firefighters and pilots, surgeons and military personnel, a mistake could cost someone’s life. Medical residents can practise surgery in VR without operating on patients or cadavers, and construction or machinery workers can practise emergency shutdown procedures. By replacing a dangerous situation with a realistic simulation, VR training can ease the pressure on trainees, and provide them invaluable hands-on experiences. \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Other companies have taken VR training into the corporate world. From sales and negotiation skills, to diversity and inclusion training, virtual training helps employees learn skills rarely focused on in schools. Experiential learning is arguably the most effective way to learn, with studies showing memory retention increases by over 75%. Simulations can expose employees to millions of situations, which when coupled with real-time feedback, become a cohesive learning tool.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Furthermore, VR can open up a new realm of creativity for creative professionals. Imagine designers sketching in three dimensional space. Imagine architects ‘constructing’ their buildings in VR, and walking clients through their creations before they’re even built,or corporation bosses conducting business in a virtual skyrise. Imagine people being able to interact, not over facetime, but personally, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers. A headset could be the doorway to an international classroom with teachers and students from all over the world.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              When we start perceiving VR as not just a fantastical escape, but as an extension of reality, we can truly unlock its potential. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            \r\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\r\n              Further reading: Learn how Virtual Reality tricks your brain. \r\n              <br />\r\n              <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybyib5pAq7Y\" className={styles.link} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybyib5pAq7Y </a>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"chelsea-chaffey\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/chelsea-chaffey.png\",\r\n              styles.anonProfile,\r\n              \"Chelsea Chaffey\",\r\n              \"Education Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost62;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost7 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #7\" />\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>How to Ace Your Hackathon</h2>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>June 21, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <p className={styles.question}>What is a Hackathon?</p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Hackathons are opportunities for students to challenge themselves\n              and showcase their skills by creating a technical product to\n              resolve real world problems.

However, they all agreed their Hackathon\n                experience would have been better if they had brainstormed and\n                researched product ideas prior to the hackathon. With teams\n                spending anywhere from 25-50 percent of their precious limited\n                time during a hackathon coming up with an idea, product\n                features, and value proposition, it’s no wonder they would\n                advise arriving with researched ideas.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <li className={styles.question}>Technical Skills Are A Must</li>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                Teams also point to the necessity for technical knowledge in the\n                group.\n              </p>\n\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                As Hackathons have a technical focus, participants are usually\n                expected to build a technical prototype from the ground up. As a\n                result, every team should have at least one person who is\n                technically well-versed so that they should be able to implement\n                a full UI given some basic sketches in less than one day. Some\n                teams cited a lack of technical expertise as a significant\n                challenge. Some ways to hit the ground running on the tech end\n                include learning a framework such as React Boilerplate, writing\n                Boilerplate code and templates, learning skills to build the\n                backend/infra such as CFN templates for AWS and familiarizing\n                yourself with rapid prototyping (Including frontend/backend web,\n                and UI sketches) before the Hackathon begins.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n            </ol>\n\n            <p className={styles.question}>Other Pearls of Wisdom</p>\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Team members shared other pearls of wisdom that will make your\n              Hackathon experience more enjoyable and productive.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <ul className={styles.list}>\n              <li className={styles.question}>\n                Arrive ready to learn and have fun!{\" \"}\n              </li>\n              <p className={styles.postContent}>\n                While these teams earned top prizes in hackathons, they did not\n                set out to win.

Leveraging AWS Cloud\n              Services for text-to-speech, transcribing, and translating, they\n              prototyped a multilingual web application to call for assistance\n              (food, water, hygiene, and emergencies) that had the potential to\n              work in tandem with already-existing technology.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The 2019 second place winner (Team Nandos; Jovann Tjuandi, Kai\n              Feng, Madeline Younes, Rebecca Tran) designed a prototype to\n              simulate everyday scenarios that allows people with autism to\n              become comfortable in everyday environments. Sharing a passion for\n              mental illness, the team members created the virtual reality\n              prototype to spread the message that mental health doesn't just\n              affect the health of the individual but it also affects them\n              socially.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The 2019 third place winner (Starks; Rahil Agrawal, Aditya Karia,\n              Sushant Adhikari, Andrew Kaploun, Brittany Evat) came up with a\n              filtering service to allow people to search for establishments\n              that have facilities to accommodate people with various\n              disabilities. With a shared passion for creating a more inclusive\n              world for those living with disabilities and diseases, the team\n              created a filtering service using integration with AWS APIs and\n              Health APIs so users could find restaurants, companies, and other\n              establishments that suit their needs.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              The second place winning team of the 2017 WIT Hackathon\n              (Christopher Shi, Mackenzie Alexander, Lena Albin, Vanessa Long)\n              created a predictive platform to help students discover their\n              career pathways. Team members were first-year students who wanted\n              to discover what career to pursue. So, they built something to\n              help themselves and other students in the same situation.

But STEM was not her first\n              choice. Initially, Marguerite was drawn to classical music and\n              dreamed of becoming a music therapist. Whilst reading the\n              discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson, Marguerite fell\n              in love with DNA in high school. She expressed that “I loved the\n              idea of solving something at the molecular level”, and was\n              immediately drawn to the complexities and excited by the\n              challenges in science.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              Graduating with a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from UNSW, Marguerite\n              was enthusiastic to start her career in the US as a postdoctoral\n              fellow at the University of Utah. Here, she really began to\n              understand the premise of a male-dominant culture in STEM. As a\n              leading advocate for women in technology, Margarite does not\n              believe there is any lack of interest, passion, or ambition for\n              girls and women to enter the STEM field. However, she outlines\n              that the field has not been the most accommodating to women,\n              especially for those who want families. She finds that the rolling\n              contracts and competitive atmosphere in STEM are unforgiving for\n              women who take career breaks to have a child, posing as a\n              significant barrier for women interested in STEM. Nonetheless, she\n              managed to successfully build a family whilst growing her career!{\" \"}\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              After her postdoctoral work, Margarite began working at St Jude\n              Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee to pursue her\n              passion for helping people, by developing current research to cure\n              patients. Here, she published her first academic article in the\n              Science publication, “Molecular Therapy.” A few years later, she\n              joined the clinical team at the Bruce Lefroy Centre for Genetic\n              Health Research at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in\n              Australia, where she works to this day and has published 15 more\n              scholarly works. She helped develop cell and gene therapies for\n              Friedreich’s Ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease that affects\n              children. The goal of her research is to understand disease\n              mechanisms and develop safe, effective therapies for Friedreich\n              ataxia that readily translate to the clinic. As a result,\n              therapies services will be more accessible to patients from\n              different backgrounds who are diagnosed with Friedreich’s Ataxia\n              backgrounds.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              As Marguerite’s career has blossomed, she has devoted herself to\n              inspiring more women and students into STEM. In 2017, she became\n              the Executive Director for the Industry Mentoring Network for\n              STEM. ” She serves on the steering committee of the Science in\n              Australia Gender Equity Forum and is the co-founder of Women in\n              Science, Australia. Reflecting on her work, she expresses that “I\n              work with a lot of young people in research and sometimes you have\n              to say to them “don’t worry, be happy!” Try not to worry about the\n              future. Just embrace it and go for it.\" Having received numerous\n              awards for her research and leadership, Marguerite says all of it\n              was possible due to her “sheer and utter determination.”\n              Marguerite’s success is living, breathing, proof that there is a\n              place for women in STEM, in research, in the hard sciences. She\n              admits that it is a difficult path, yet the obstacles look\n              surmountable, and the rewards large because of women like\n              Marguerite.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\n        <AuthorCard\n          authors={{\n            \"vivian-wong\": [\n              \"/potraits/blog-authors/vivw.jpg\",\n              styles.authorProfile,\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\n              \"Education Executive\",\n            ],\n          }}\n        />\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default blogPost8;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \".././style.css\";\nimport styles from \"./blog-post.module.css\";\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\nimport ShareBtns from \"./ShareBtns\";\n\nclass blogPost9 extends Component {\n  //start webpage at the top\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\n        <PageHeader imgUrl=\"/headers/blog-header.jpg\" title=\"Blog Post #9\" />\n\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\n        <div className={styles.blogContent}>\n          <div>\n            <h2 className={styles.blogTitle}>\n              What Are You <em>Really</em> Procrastinating?\n            </h2>\n            <p className={styles.blogSubtitle}>\n              Inspired by Tim Urban’s TED Talk “Inside the Mind of a Master\n              Procrastinator”\n            </p>\n            <div className={styles.blogDetails}>\n              <span className={styles.date}>June 29, 2020</span>\n              <span>\n                <ShareBtns />\n              </span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className={styles.post}>\n            <div className={styles.videoWrapper}>\n              <iframe\n                title=\"Tim Urban’s TED Talk “Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator” \"\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/arj7oStGLkU\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n                webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n                mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n              />\n            </div>\n\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p className={styles.postContent}>\n              To be honest, I don’t consider myself a master procrastinator.
