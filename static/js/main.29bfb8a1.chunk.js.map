Her passions collide in her role as a senior consultant of the SuccessFactors Team at PwC Australia. With a keen understanding of her client’s strategic business objectives and the feasibility of system design, she thrives in creating solutions for clients that allow them to operate more efficiently.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">Let’s read what Silvia had to say about her journey into tech below </p>\r\n\r\n              <ol class=\"list\">\r\n                <li class=\"question\">What sparked your interest to join the field of STEM? </li>\r\n                <p class=\"post-content\"> I definitely \"stumbled\" into the field of STEM, it was never an area quite popular in highschool when we are picking our future degrees. I was introduced to it as part of the Co-op program and just went with it since I didn't know what to do. Mind you I definitely struggled in my first year of studying tech, I definitely thought I was the odd one out, was struggling to understand basic concepts of SQL and was prepared to quit and leave it all behind. I definitely think the turning point was meeting Blair, who gave me a personalised presentation slides of why I/women should stay in tech and the Info systems support circle that really opened my eyes about the opportunities in tech. I definitely would not have lasted my first year of uni without any of them. Once you enter the industry you realise how many awesome opportunities there are, and that there is definitely a role for everyone regardless what background you come from. It's not just all coding, or all project management. There's a happy space for everyone.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n                <li class=\"question\">Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:</li>\r\n                <p class=\"post-content\">I have been quite fortunate in working at several amazing places within the tech industry. I started off a planning and research analyst at the Reserve Bank of Australia, before trying out the Cyber security space in IAG. I then interned at PwC's Experience and Insights Team and gave a shot at strategy consulting at Deloitte's S&I team. I am now a senior consultant in PwC's Technology Consulting team, specifically in the SuccessFactors team.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n                <li class=\"question\">Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?</li>\r\n                <p class=\"post-content\">Absolutely no idea! I think over the years I have realised certain aspects I enjoy, and that is I like to help people and clearly see that my work is contributing to a good cause. I am always learning regardless where I end up, so I try not to aim for a \"final destination\", rather I think about what other areas I can learn from. I definitely do want to move to another country just to understand how the tech industry is like in another geographic region. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n                <li class=\"question\"> What do you love about your career now?</li>\r\n                <p class=\"post-content\"> I love how I get to try out a variety of roles and work with different industries. What was really interesting for me was that I was the second member of the SuccessFactors team alongside my director, and really I got to help build the team and work with some amazing people - Kudos to Lynsye. Everyday I am not stuck at a routine, yes sometimes certain days are tougher than others, but it certainly makes it enjoyable when you see the impact your work has to make your client's job run more efficiently and effectively and by extension helping support our society. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n                <li class=\"question\">Favourite Quote or Motto?</li>\r\n                <p class=\"post-content\">\"Do it for yourself, not to prove to others\" - Dr Carmen Leong</p>\r\n              </ol>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"vivian-wong\":[\"/potraits/vivw.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Vivian Wong\", \"Education Executive\"]}}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost1;\r\n","//All necessary imports for this javascript\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost2 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n          <div>\r\n          {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n          <PageHeader\r\n            imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n            title=\"Blog Post #2\"\r\n          />\r\n\r\n            {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n            <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n              <div>\r\n                <h2 class = \"blog-title\">Introducing: Professor Lisa Harvey Smith, Astrophysicist and Australia’s First Women In STEM Ambassador</h2>\r\n                <p class=\"date\"> 27th May 2020 </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n              <div class=\"post\">\r\n                  <p class=\"post-content\">British-Australian astrophysicist Lisa Harvey Smith discovered her love of astronomy whilst homeschooling herself at the age 11. Soon after, she joined her first amateur astronomical society. Her love for astronomy, which she describes as “ridiculous” guided her educational pursuits. By age 26, she had already earned a Ph.D. in Radio Astronomy. Her work on the SKA Pathfinder telescope led to the discovery of tens of millions of new galaxies. And if solving the mysteries of the universe isn’t enough, in 2018, she was appointed the Australian Government Ambassador for Women in STEM.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"post-content\">Dr. Harvey shares astronomical concepts with women in ways that are interesting and accessible. She explains her reason for being a science communicator and educator instead of a traditional teacher is because: “I wanted to use my creativity rather than teach in a confined setting – that’s what I love about science communication, the creative aspect. The challenge of breaking out of my science niche and cutting through the jargon and explaining these cool concepts. I find it challenging and engaging and I love watching people’s faces as the penny drops.”</p><br/>\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"post-content\">If Dr. Harvey had to be described in one word, it would be ambitious. When she’s not conducting astronomical research and sharing her love of astronomy with others, she’s advocating for women in the workplace. In her 10-year plan for Women in STEM, she urges the need to accelerate the pace of change in reducing the gender pay gap for women. In her address to the National Press Club in 2019, she warned that it will take more than 200 years to close the gap at the current rate of progress. Her research on unconscious bias in the workplace and her advocacy has already led to improvements in the hiring process. Companies are now removing gendered pronouns in applications so that more women will receive research grants and job opportunities.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"post-content\">Currently, women make up only 17% of the STEM qualified population in Australia. Professor Harvey Smith advises that it is the responsibility of students, educators, parents, and businesses to encourage, promote, and raise awareness for all women in STEM. As an author for young children, her wish is for young girls to see smart and empowering female leaders involved in science and technology and feel a part of the STEM community. She urges, “Instead of asking girls what the colour of the flower is, ask how many flowers there are.” By encouraging young females to think mathematically and scientifically, she believes more females will seek careers in STEM and gender equity will become the norm.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"post-content\">Professor Lisa Harvey Smith shows us that successful females not only have love, determination and exploration for their own fields, but they also make time to encourage women in STEM.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n                  <p class=\"post-content\">Professor Lisa Harvey Smith is currently the Professor of Practice at UNSW.</p><br/>\r\n              </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n          <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\"elisa-sanjurjo\":[\"/potraits/elisa.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Elisa Sanjurjo\", \"Education Team\"], \"victoria-ruming\":[\"/potraits/victoria.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Victoria Ruming\",\"Education Team\"]}}\r\n          />\r\n          {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost2;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost3 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #3\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h2 class = \"blog-title\">4 Lessons From Marissa Mayer's Life in Tech</h2>\r\n          <p class = \"date\"> 3rd June 2020 </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"post\">\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">High achiever, resilience, and persistence are not unknown to tech CEO Marissa Mayer. Mayer has an inspirational journey, from becoming the first female software engineer at Google while Google was still a start-up, the CEO of Yahoo! despite the criticism surrounding her, all the way to founding her own AI start-up. She has continually broken barriers in technology and has been the talk of the world. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">In this week’s blog, we take a look at 4 lessons we can learn from her amazing life, and how she continues to redefine technology as we know it today.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">  Lesson 1: Computer Science is a form of Art </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Perhaps “art” is not the first thing that comes to our mind when considering technology.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Yet this is what sparked Mayer’s interest in technology when she undertook a degree in Symbolic Systems at Stanford University. It involved exploring philosophy, linguistics, computer science and examining the complexity and depth in how people think and seeing how computers can reflect that same logic.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Mayer took this view to her tech projects, resulting in an impact in tech that goes beyond computers, and redefines the way people think.\r\n        </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">Lesson 2: Feeling Confident Even When Feeling Unprepared </p><br/>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\"> Big decisions are daunting. Marissa Mayer was no stranger to feeling unprepared when making big decisions at certain stages of her life.\r\n        </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\"> Mayer had a whopping 14 job offers lined up after finishing her studies from Stanford University. Each offer was diverse and exciting, but after weeks of anxiety, stress, and support from her mentors, she chose her life-changing role at Google, based on two things:\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li class = \"list\"> Surrounding herself with smart, ambitious and like-minded people.</li>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <li class = \"list\"> Pursuing a role that she didn’t feel totally prepared for, a role that would challenge her, pushing her out of her comfort zone, thus allowing her to grow personally and professionally.</li>\r\n            </ol> <br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">Lesson 3: Dealing with Scrutiny\r\n        </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">Our daring goals in life, though exciting for us, are often matched with scrutiny from others.\r\n        </p>\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">For Mayer, this arises when she began working as a CEO at Yahoo!</p>\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">Instead of receiving support as a female executive who was working in a male-dominated industry, she found criticism. Instead of receiving optimism for new ideas, she was handed pessimism.</p>\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">As she redefined business models, strategizing for both the company’s short and long term goals, and implementing new initiatives in response to the constant disruption in the tech industry (for the better), the media took the opportunity to slam and criticize her decisions as well as her work ethic.</p>\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">But Mayer didn’t let it phase her. Instead, she took the progressive side of the criticism, pulling out valuable feedback that had been made, and was motivated by it to keep achieving more.</p>\r\n\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <p class = \"question\">Lesson 4: The Daring Side of Reinventing </p> <br/>\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">Starting something brand-new, challenging the convention, and fear of failure is something we all grapple with.</p>\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">Mayer’s work at Google began as the internet began to change the world. She designed Google’s search interface, was involved in major product management including Gmail, and developed systems for customising searches on Google.</p>\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">Motivating her team at Yahoo! to achieve success was challenging. Instead of attempting to fix the declining lines of business, she led her team to recreate them, investing in mobile apps at the brink of their popularity. Redesigning a major company was a huge risk and although Yahoo! was later sold to Verizon, Mayer was a fundamental key in its future success.</p>\r\n            <p class = \"post-content\">After her resignation at Yahoo!, Mayer began her own start-up Lumi Labs, a business that utilises AI to complete mundane tasks. Lumi Labs gave Mayer the perfect opportunity to reinvent her own success, building a business based on passion, embracing new opportunities with confidence, viewing computer science as art, taking scrutiny in her stride, and seeing for herself the daring side of reinventing. </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"georgie-mansfield\":[\"/potraits/georgie.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Georgie Mansfield\", \"Education Team\"]}}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost3;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost4 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #4\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class = \"blog-title\">Introducing: Syin Li Tan, Consultant at Deloitte</h2>\r\n            <p class = \"date\"> 10th June 2020 </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">Syin Li Tan has all the hallmarks of a promising career at Deloitte Consulting in Australia.

Afterwards, she enjoyed a placement in the Particles and Catalysis Research Group (PARTCAT) of UNSW, and continued with the group for her PhD programme from 2016 to 2020. The following interview outlines Salina’s journey, as well as advice about finding success in university and beyond.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What is your research about?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Due to the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, there is a need to mitigate their impact on the environment. One method is to utilise CO2 as a feedstock for fuel production. My PhD research focused on the engineering of nickel catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methane. The reaction aims to promote process sustainability by occurring under photothermal conditions, dependent on the light-to-heat conversion. Similar to most chemical reactions, a catalyst is needed for the reaction. The scope of my work involved probing the impact of catalyst support properties, separating the effects of light and heat in the reaction, and understanding the role of defects in the catalyst.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What are the limitations of your research?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Relative to other conditions of CO2 conversion to methane, photothermal conditions and the number of catalysts tested have not been probed as extensively. Therefore, there are limitations in terms of understanding such as on the catalyst properties that influence the reaction.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What inspired you to explore your research topic?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Prior to my PhD studies, my research project during the MEng programme (at the University of Sheffield) also involved utilising CO2 as a building block. I found the concept to be very interesting because it involved producing a valuable product from something that would have essentially become ‘waste’.  I was drawn by the sustainability aspect of the process and how it addresses the current environmental issues.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What challenges/conflicts have you faced in your studies or your research?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">There’s a lot of new skills to learn and responsibilities to undertake, which can be challenging at first. However, it’s just a matter of working through it and over time, new concepts would be easier to grasp. Challenges can also be a source of motivation, such as when testing a new material and anticipating the result. Some experiments take several hours or days, and waiting to observe the outcome is very exciting.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What skills are most important in order to successfully complete a research project?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">In my experience, the skills I found important were time management, perseverance, patience, creativity, and communication.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What piece of advice would you give your younger self?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I would say that my experience at the beginning of my PhD programme was a steep learning curve. There was a lot to learn, process, and skills to acquire. I think that the advice I would give to my younger self would be to be patient with myself, always be proactive in seeking resolution, and the importance of a supportive network. Guidance and support from attentive supervisors also have a strong influence on the experience. Additionally, I frequently talk through my ideas and challenges with friends, who were great at listening and help process my thoughts. It is equally important for me to be present and supportive.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I would also tell myself to find a hobby or learn new skills. It’s a good way to give yourself a break.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">How did you open opportunities for yourself?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I think that it’s important to be proactive with your goals, consistently work on improving skills, and be enthusiastic to learn new things. Based on my experience, when I was an undergrad student, I knew that I wanted to do a PhD degree after graduation and so I was keen to do research placements during my university breaks. Finding a placement definitely takes time and motivation. As I was looking for work experience in Australia while I was in England, I started almost one year prior to find a placement. I was very fortunate to have gained research experience at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Melbourne and with PARTCAT at UNSW during the summer after Year 2 and 3, respectively. The experience from both places were invaluable and I am incredibly grateful to my supervisors and colleagues.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">In your opinion, what are the most important skills needed in the workforce?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I would say that the important skills are honesty, time management, critical thinking, and communication. My PhD studies was definitely a time that I’ve acquired many technical skills and new understanding, which are transferable to the workforce. There are also non-technical skills developed which builds your character.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What is your biggest eye-opening moment in recent years?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">In terms of research, it’s very interesting to read on new findings and developments in the area of interest, which inspires and shifts your perspective on an issue.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">As for personal reflection, it’s interesting to see how far my life has come since high school and the unexpected events that happen. I find that over time, challenges are easier to deal with and to give myself more credit for the things I’ve achieved.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What would you like the impact of your research to be?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I hope that the findings from my work would be beneficial for future researchers. With the ongoing efforts for a sustainable society, I hope that my work has made an impact.</p><br/>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"vivian-wong\":[\"/potraits/vivw.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Vivian Wong\", \"Education Executive\"], \"victoria-ruming\":[\"/potraits/victoria.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Victoria Ruming\",\"Education Team\"]}}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost5;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost6 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #6\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class = \"blog-title\">Introducing: Fontaine Foxworth, Product Manager of Google</h2>\r\n            <p class = \"date\"> 17th June 2020 </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Despite studying Civil Engineering at Stanford University, Fontaine Foxworth discovered her true passions\r\n            within computer-science and technology, and is now a Mobile Product manager.

With teams spending\r\n            anywhere from 25-50 percent of their precious limited time during a\r\n            hackathon coming up with an idea, product features, and value proposition,\r\n            it’s no wonder they would advise arriving with researched ideas. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <li class=\"question\">Technical Skills Are A Must</li>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Teams also point to the necessity for technical knowledge in the group. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">As Hackathons have a technical focus, participants\r\n            are usually expected to build a technical prototype from the ground up. As\r\n            a result, every team should have at least one person who is technically\r\n            well-versed so that they should be able to implement a full UI given some\r\n            basic sketches in less than one day. Some teams cited a lack of\r\n            technical expertise as a significant challenge. Some ways to hit\r\n            the ground running on the tech end include learning a framework such as\r\n            React Boilerplate, writing Boilerplate code and templates, learning\r\n            skills to build the backend/infra such as CFN templates for AWS and\r\n            familiarizing yourself with rapid prototyping (Including frontend/backend web,\r\n              and UI sketches) before the Hackathon begins.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            </ol>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">Other Pearls of Wisdom</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Team members shared other pearls of wisdom that\r\n            will make your Hackathon experience more enjoyable and productive. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <ul class=\"list\">\r\n            <li class=\"question\">Arrive ready to learn and have fun! </li>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">While these teams earned top prizes in hackathons,\r\n            they did not set out to win. They felt that would put unnecessary pressure\r\n            on them. Instead, they all entered the Hackathons with the intent to\r\n            learn and have fun. Boy, did it pay off!</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <li class=\"question\">Decide how to spend your time and divide responsibilities. </li>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Teams agreed that all members should be part of\r\n            the idea creation and research phase and found various ways to\r\n            divide other responsibilities based on team members’ strengths.\r\n            Some common categories include technology (e.g. coding and prototype\r\n              development), business model creation, and presentation (slide creation and delivery).\r\n              One team advised separating what needs a working demonstration with code\r\n              and what can be shown through image mockups. Image mockups allow people\r\n              to see what it would look like and how it would work on a website\r\n              such as proto.io.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <li class=\"question\">Share knowledge between team members. </li>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Regardless of how tasks are divided, it’s important\r\n            that members stay abreast of developments amongst their team. One team\r\n            recommended creating a Google Document where members can share their\r\n            knowledge and progress with other team members. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <li class=\"question\">Time pressure is a real challenge, so arrive with\r\n            strategies to overcome it. </li>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">All teams face challenges in hackathons, with\r\n            time pressure being the most commonly-cited challenge. Teams were\r\n            particularly surprised by how long it took to come up with a great\r\n            idea and prepare for their presentations. One team made too many major\r\n            changes after the initial design phase and ran out of time. Students\r\n            cited working as a team with members who were encouraging and\r\n            motivating, as vital to their ability to overcome challenges and\r\n            succeed. One team suggested preparing motivational music for\r\n            intense times.</p><br/>\r\n            </ul>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">Examples of winning products and projects </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">The winning teams have certainly earned the right\r\n            to advise others on how to have a successful hackathon experience.\r\n            Let’s look at the awesome ideas and products these teams developed\r\n            during the WIT Hackathon!</p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">In 2019, the first place winner (Hungry Hakkers;\r\n              Victor Tsang, Kevin Lou, Sebastian Hodge, Iris Chong, Christine Wu)\r\n            developed an application to help streamline caretakers' work in nursing\r\n            homes. Their goal was to prototype a solution that would be of minimal\r\n            cost and easy to use for the elderly, while also being the most convenient\r\n            for the understaffed workers. Leveraging AWS Cloud Services for text-to-speech,\r\n            transcribing, and translating, they prototyped a multilingual web application\r\n            to call for assistance (food, water, hygiene, and emergencies) that had\r\n            the potential to work in tandem with already-existing technology.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">The 2019 second place winner (Team Nandos;\r\n              Jovann Tjuandi, Kai Feng, Madeline Younes, Rebecca Tran) designed a\r\n            prototype to simulate everyday scenarios that allows people with autism to\r\n            become comfortable in everyday environments. Sharing a passion for\r\n            mental illness, the team members created the virtual reality prototype\r\n              to spread the message that mental health doesn't just affect the\r\n              health of the individual but it also affects them socially.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">The 2019 third place winner (Starks;\r\n              Rahil Agrawal, Aditya Karia, Sushant Adhikari, Andrew Kaploun,\r\n              Brittany Evat) came up with a filtering service to allow people to search\r\n              for establishments that have facilities to accommodate people\r\n              with various disabilities. With a shared passion for creating\r\n              a more inclusive world for those living with disabilities\r\n              and diseases, the team created a filtering service using\r\n              integration with AWS APIs and Health APIs so users could find\r\n              restaurants, companies, and other establishments that suit their needs. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">The second place winning team of the 2017 WIT Hackathon\r\n            (Christopher Shi, Mackenzie Alexander, Lena Albin, Vanessa Long) created\r\n              a predictive platform to help students discover their career pathways.\r\n              Team members were first-year students who wanted to discover what career\r\n              to pursue. So, they built something to help themselves and other students\r\n              in the same situation. Students complete psychometric quizzes and video\r\n              interviews, AI evaluates the interviews, and the platform provides students\r\n              with potential career pathways and opportunities. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">We would like to share a special thanks to Victor\r\n            Tsang, Madeline Younes, Kai Feng, Rahil Agrawal and Christopher Shi\r\n            for helping with this blog post. As representatives of past winning\r\n            teams, your advice will allow future WIT Hackathon participants\r\n            to have a positive experience and create meaningful and relevant solutions. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n            <AuthorCard\r\n            authors={{\"vivian-wong\":[\"/potraits/vivw.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Vivian Wong\", \"Education Executive\"]}}\r\n            />\r\n            {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost7;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost8 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #8\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class = \"blog-title\">WIT Crush Wednesday - Dr Marguerite Evans-Galea</h2>\r\n            <p class = \"date\"> 24th June 2020 </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Dr. Marguerite Evans-Galea is one of Australia’s leading\r\n            scientists, respected and known internationally for her research in cell and\r\n            gene therapies.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">In a 2017 radio interview published by ABC Sunday Extra in 2017, Marguerite\r\n            reflected on her path into STEM and the challenges women faced entering these\r\n            professions. But STEM was not her first choice. Initially, Marguerite was drawn\r\n            to classical music and dreamed of becoming a music therapist. Whilst reading the\r\n            discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson, Marguerite fell in love with DNA\r\n              in high school. She expressed that “I loved the idea of solving something at the\r\n              molecular level”, and was immediately drawn to the complexities and excited by\r\n              the challenges in science.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Graduating with a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from UNSW, Marguerite was\r\n            enthusiastic to start her career in the US as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah.\r\n            Here, she really began to understand the premise of a male-dominant culture in STEM. As a\r\n            leading advocate for women in technology, Margarite does not believe there is any lack of\r\n            interest, passion, or ambition for girls and women to enter the STEM field. However, she\r\n            outlines that the field has not been the most accommodating to women, especially for those\r\n            who want families. She finds that the rolling contracts and competitive atmosphere in STEM\r\n            are unforgiving for women who take career breaks to have a child, posing as a significant barrier\r\n            for women interested in STEM. Nonetheless, she managed to successfully build a family whilst\r\n            growing her career! </p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">After her postdoctoral work, Margarite began working at St Jude Children's\r\n            Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee to pursue her passion for helping people, by developing\r\n            current research to cure patients. Here, she published her first academic article in the Science\r\n            publication, “Molecular Therapy.” A few years later, she joined the clinical team at the Bruce Lefroy\r\n            Centre for Genetic Health Research at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia,\r\n            where she works to this day and has published 15 more scholarly works. She helped develop cell\r\n            and gene therapies for Friedreich’s Ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease that affects children.\r\n            The goal of her research is to understand disease mechanisms and develop safe, effective therapies\r\n            for Friedreich ataxia that readily translate to the clinic. As a result, therapies services will be\r\n            more accessible to patients from different backgrounds who are diagnosed with Friedreich’s Ataxia\r\n            backgrounds.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">As Marguerite’s career has blossomed, she has devoted herself to\r\n            inspiring more women and students into STEM. In 2017, she became the Executive Director for the\r\n            Industry Mentoring Network for STEM. ” She serves on the steering committee of the Science in\r\n            Australia Gender Equity Forum and is the co-founder of Women in Science, Australia. Reflecting on\r\n            her work, she expresses that “I work with a lot of young people in research and sometimes you have\r\n            to say to them “don’t worry, be happy!” Try not to worry about the future. Just embrace it and go for it.\"\r\n            Having received numerous awards for her research and leadership, Marguerite says all of it was possible\r\n            due to her “sheer and utter determination.” Marguerite’s success is living, breathing, proof that\r\n            there is a place for women in STEM, in research, in the hard sciences. She admits that it is a\r\n            difficult path, yet the obstacles look surmountable, and the rewards large because of women like\r\n            Marguerite.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n         {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n         <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"vivian-wong\":[\"/potraits/vivw.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Vivian Wong\", \"Education Executive\"]}}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost8;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost9 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #9\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class = \"blog-title\">What Are You <em>Really</em> Procrastinating?</h2>\r\n            <p class = \"blog-subtitle\">Inspired by Tim Urban’s TED Talk\r\n            “Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator”</p>\r\n            <p class = \"date\"> 29th June 2020 </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n            <div class=\"videoWrapper\">\r\n              <iframe title=\"Tim Urban’s TED Talk “Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator” \" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/arj7oStGLkU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\r\n              webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" \r\n              mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <br/><br/><p class=\"post-content\">To be honest, I don’t consider myself a master\r\n            procrastinator. I start an assignment and study the day we’re notified, and\r\n            although I leave the rest of the work until a couple of days before it’s due, as\r\n            the anxious person I am, I panic early enough to get the work done on time and do\r\n            it well. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">That’s all I really associated with procrastination with,\r\n            assignments, bills, <b>deadlines.*</b> </p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">And then I watched Tim Urban’s TED Talk “Inside the Mind of a\r\n            Master Procrastinator”. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">The talk begins with funny, light-hearted stories of the scary kind\r\n            of procrastination, leaving the <b><u>whole</u></b> project to the last minute, but haha, I would never do that! Yet even though I never thought myself to be a master procrastinator, the Instant Gratification Monkey who sought instant satisfaction and the Panic Monster who came bolting in at the last moment that Tim Urban described related a little too closely than I expected to the ‘non-extremist’ procrastinator I believed myself to be. But still, I laughed along.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">That’s when humour was pushed aside and the actual issue came\r\n            through with this picture: </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"pic\">\r\n              <img\r\n                src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/blog-attachments/blog-9-box.png\"}\r\n                alt=\"boxes-of-life\"\r\n                resizeMode=\"contain\"\r\n                />\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">This picture shows one box for every week in a 90-year life. When\r\n            you really look at it, there’s not a lot. That’s the moment when as a 19-year-old, my life\r\n            had never felt shorter. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">All I could see jumping out at me was 20% of my life, where I\r\n            hadn’t learnt Hebrew, I hadn’t travelled to the Middle East again, and I hadn’t repainted\r\n            my room. Things I said I would do, but never have.

Funnily enough, I turned back to the Senior Reading List my\r\n                    Year 10 English teacher gave to me, and my love for classics came rushing back.\r\n                    </p><br/>\r\n\r\n                    <p class=\"post-content\">Your something-you-love doesn’t need to be something new,\r\n                    it just needs to make you happy, and make you proud of it.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <li class=\"question\">Goal setting</li><br/>\r\n                    <p class=\"post-content\"> Every year I write 10 goals that I want to achieve.\r\n                    They’re mostly academic goals, like getting a good WAM and applying for an\r\n                    internship, but now I try to push them a bit beyond that. My goals this year also\r\n                    include finding a place that makes good burgers, joining a subcommittee (Success!),\r\n                    and learning Hebrew. I think it’s important to have a balance of academic and life\r\n                    goals, and also allow myself some ‘instant gratification’ goals that I can achieve\r\n                    quickly to keep me motivated while pressing towards the long-term goals on the\r\n                    list. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            </ol>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\"> Since the first time I watched this TED Talk, I have tried to\r\n            smash through goals, ambitions, and self-projects as quickly as I could. Turns out, <b><em>everyone</em></b> procrastinates, even the non-procrastinators. Procrastination isn’t about being done before the due date, it’s literally a question about whether you are making the most of your life, making the most of each box on that calendar, and doing something that means something to you on a deeper level. Surprisingly, I’ve found a lot more fulfilment in doing something that doesn’t have a deadline, that you learn a bit more from, that makes you a more rounded person, even though no one else can really see it. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\"> No doubt, I’m still a procrastinator. I will always finish\r\n            assignments the night before, keep leaving home 2 minutes before the bus arrives, and will\r\n            probably continue paying my student contribution fees the day of class registration.

However, I am here\r\n            to tell you the answer to that question, and the answer is… probably not. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Why? Because Artificial Intelligence needs humans, and humans need AI.\r\n            AI is creating new industries, changing the way businesses work and changing what the workplace\r\n            looks like. However, it is not replacing people but helping people with their jobs.</p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\"><b>So, what does AI in the workplace look like?</b></p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">AI is helping the medical industry to not only create new jobs and research\r\n            opportunities but to better the lives of people affected by diseases. <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/project-euphonia/\">\r\n            Project Euphonia</a> at Google AI is giving people with Amyotrophic Lateral\r\n            Sclerosis (ALS) the ability to communicate and be understood.\r\n            After recording thousands of phrases of ALS patients at varying stages of their illness, the team has\r\n            trained voice recognition software to understand impaired speech and convert it into text. In the later\r\n            stages of ALS, it can be almost impossible to understand a person’s speech, and AI is giving them the\r\n            ability to communicate.  </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">This is where society can realize the outstanding benefits of AI. It can understand\r\n            humans when other humans can’t. It is able to process mass volumes of data at incredible speeds. It can drive\r\n            vehicles, predict eye disease and even make us pizza. But what it can’t do is learn in isolation and that’s why\r\n            this technology needs to be utilized for good.</p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\"><b>How Will AI Affect Job Loss and Growth?</b></p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Gartner predicts that in 2020, 2.3 million new jobs in the health care, public sector,\r\n            and education sectors will be created by AI. At the same time, manufacturing jobs will be eliminated as a result\r\n            of AI, perhaps as many as 1.8 million jobs.</p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\"><b>AI is Not All Powerful</b></p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Researchers at <a href=\"https://robohub.org/\">RoboHub</a> at the University of Waterloo\r\n            said the biggest misconception among the public is that robots are far more capable than they are. The researchers\r\n            are trying to teach their robots to see and perceive the world like humans. In their opinion, AI works best in\r\n            environments that are controlled and predictable like the construction or manufacturing industry. Here AI can help\r\n            to reduce human error and make workplaces safer.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Humans are learning from AI, working with AI and understanding the benefits of AI. In the\r\n            Construction, Manufacturing, Food or Medical industry, AI can only succeed when partnered with humans. And that’s why…\r\n            AI is not going to take your job, and may in fact, create a new world of job possibilities.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"elisa-sanjurjo\":[\"/potraits/elisa.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Elisa Sanjurjo\", \"Education team\"]}}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost11;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost12 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #12\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class = \"blog-title\">WIT Crush Wednesday - Maddie Mackey</h2>\r\n            <p class = \"date\"> 8th July 2020 </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">“Maddie Mackey is a Junior Software Engineer at Nine.

I didn't know what engineering really was, but I knew I didn't struggle too much with maths, and that I had a good balance of problem solving and creative thinking. Engineering seemed like a good place to start.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">During my studies I interned with Google in Sydney and Seattle, worked at an AI startup, and tutored many subjects at UNSW. I worked as a Software Engineer at Macquarie Group for two years after graduating, and recently took a new role as a Creative Technologist at a tech education company called Creatable. I’ve also kept teaching casually on the side with Code Like A Girl and Coder Academy!</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I see myself making technology more accessible and exciting for young women, while exploring the ways that technology intersects with and enhances other industries and disciplines.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What do you love about your career now?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I love that my career is now a genuine expression of who I am. I feel like I can be my best self when I’m using my skills to pursue my passions. Investing in the future of young women is engaging and the passion is infectious, I’ve never felt more supported by people who have watched me grow.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">Why do you think it is important to empower women and increase their involvement in the STEM industry?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">All roles will require some level of technical proficiency, whether that’s abstract skills like problem solving and ideation, or ‘hard skills’ like deeper computing literacy and specialised technical knowledge. The STEM industry is the future of work, and diversity begets more inclusive and creative solutions. It is imperative that women are able to have a hand in building the future they will inhabit.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">Favourite Quote or Motto?</p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\"Never let perfection get in the way of good enough\". I know that sounds like a motto for people who want to slack off, but it has helped me course correct when I let perfectionism get in the way of acknowledging my progress and success.</p><br/>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"vivian-wong\":[\"/potraits/vivw.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Vivian Wong\",\"Education Executive\"]}}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost14;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost15 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #15\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class = \"blog-title\">A Journey in IT with Zitni Handoo</h2>\r\n            <p class = \"date\">19th July 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Zitni, a final year IT masters student from India,\r\n            dreams big. She would love to use her knowledge of AI to contribute to solving\r\n            problems like cyber attacks or diagnosing diseases. In this blog post, we share\r\n            our Q&A with Zitni, covering everything from her inspiration to study AI to the\r\n            most challenging aspects of university life. Get ready to take some notes! </p><br/>\r\n            \r\n            <p class=\"question\">What is your degree about?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I'm studying Information Technology, and my specialization\r\n            is Artificial Intelligence.The courses are mostly technical and involve lots of\r\n            coding, broadly covering major aspects of IT.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What inspired you to explore your topic?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">During my bachelor’s studies, I took up Artificial\r\n            Intelligence as one of my subjects. While studying it, I realized just how much I\r\n            was fascinated by it and how I wanted to explore the field in-depth. I've been a fan\r\n            of reading Sci-fi novels since I was a teenager, and I have read quite a bit with AI\r\n            in them. And again, I've never felt like it when it comes to any other subject that\r\n            I've studied. I just knew that my further studies had to be related to AI. AI is\r\n            literally going to be incorporated in almost every aspect of our lives in the years\r\n            to come. It has already begun and it’s only a matter of time before it starts booming\r\n            rapidly. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What skills are most important in order to successfully complete the degree?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I believe that it's very important to be diligent in your studies,\r\n            and consistent hard and smart work is the key. Things can get overwhelming at times, and\r\n            that's alright. What's important is that we give our best and stay patient. Throughout the\r\n            degree, there will be various opportunities to interact with fellow students and work on\r\n            projects - so effective communication also plays a very important role. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What piece of advice would you give your younger self?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I would tell my younger self to continue working without thinking of\r\n            the outcome and enjoy what you're studying. It's so important to enjoy what you do, and once\r\n            you do that, things will automatically fall into place.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">How did you open opportunities to yourself?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">I attended all the lectures and interacted with the professors and\r\n            students to learn about opportunities. And I also actively took part in any volunteering\r\n            opportunities I learned about. During the second trimester, I volunteered for the RoboCup\r\n            event at the ICC and frankly, it was really amazing!</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">In your opinion, what are the most important skills needed in the workforce?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Technical skills are important, like coding. In addition, various\r\n            soft skills are vital like good communication, teamwork, analytical abilities, problem solving,\r\n            management, and critical thinking.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What is your biggest eye-opening moment in recent years?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">The biggest eye opening moment was realizing that if I'm determined to\r\n            do something which I am passionate about, it will go a long way in helping me come over the obstacles\r\n            along the way. A lot of difficulties arise when pursuing a degree. But I realized that if there is any\r\n            moment where I'm not sure of what to do, I can seek comfort in knowing that I'm pursuing what I am\r\n            extremely passionate about, and continue working. This idea has been really eye-opening. You not only\r\n            tend to succeed in what you are pursuing; you start to believe in yourself in a way you've never\r\n            before.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">What would you like the impact of your degree to be?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">The applications of AI are spreading far and wide - from driverless cars to\r\n            cybersecurity intelligence to virtual assistants. I'd like my education to serve the society in a\r\n            positive way - for example, maybe work to better disease diagnosis and medication to provide these\r\n            facilities to people anytime anywhere, or even security enhancement, where AI technology could be used\r\n            to understand and improve the cyber environment and help prevent attacks. Or maybe I could use this\r\n            technology for the agricultural sector, allowing farmers to know everything using their devices such\r\n            as detecting pests and predicting crop yields.</p><br/>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"vivian-wong\":[\"/potraits/vivw.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Vivian Wong\",\"Education Executive\"]}}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost15;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost16 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #16\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class = \"blog-title\">Introducing Erica Joy Baker, Director of Engineering at GitHub</h2>\r\n            <p class = \"date\">22nd July 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n          <p class=\"question\">Summary of Career/notoriety</p>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">Erica Joy Baker has worked in impressive engineer and management roles at some of the world's top tech companies such as GitHub, Google, Slack and Microsoft but she is best known for her outspoken advocacy for diversity and inclusion in the tech world. </p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"question\">Path into Stem</p>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">Erica’s childhood was unique in many ways. Born in Germany to parents in the US Air Force, she moved frequently, living in many US states. While computers were primitive and novel during the 1980s, Erica had access to them earlier than most kids. Her mum created combat plans for the Air Force on a computer in their home, which Erica got to play on. In fifth grade, her teacher selected her to go to a training for the precursor to the World Wide Web and she was hooked. In an <a href=\"https://techiesproject.com/erica-baker/\">interview she had with Techies Project</a>, Erica recalls thinking, “I love this. I want to do this.” From that moment on, Erica delved into the world of technology, learning how to install programs, hack, and write code. Naturally, she decided to study computer science at university. But attending the University of Miami was not what she expected and she didn’t like it. She was one of the only women and one of the only black students. She felt like an outsider that wasn’t accepted, so she transferred to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where she earned an associate’s degree in what we would refer to today as information technology. From there, she launched her career at the university. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">Erica’s experience at the University of Miami was the first of many uncomfortable experiences she would have as a black woman working in tech. Whilst working at Google a decade after graduation, she recalls that the CEO mistook her as an assistant instead of an engineer. When the CEO discovered she was an engineer, he wanted to work with a male instead, and advised her to hang a door sign that explained her role, unlike any other engineers. The situation was not unique, and Erica grew frustrated that her colleagues did not see her as capable as her white, male counterparts. She came to realize that there were some workplace cultures where she would not be able to succeed, no matter how hard she was willing to work. This inspired her to advocate that companies should not only hire but retain minority employees. It also sparked her idea to create an internal spreadsheet where Google employees reported their salary data to better understand pay disparities within the company.</p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"question\">Career Success</p>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">In addition to Google, Erica has worked for other well known companies in Silicon Valley including GitHub, Slack, Patreon, and Microsoft. She’s come a long way since she began her career working in tech support for her university! Today, she serves as the Director of Engineering at Github. </p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"question\">Advocacy</p>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">Along with her commitment to excellence in her work, Erica is passionate about diversity and inclusion in STEM, by creating environments that are welcoming toward women and people of color. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">As a coveted public speaker who has appeared on the TED stage, Erica embraces the opportunity to use her voice to start conversations about sexism and racism to propel change in the workplace. In a 2016 interview with Techies Project, Erica said, “Right now I get to have this voice—people listen to me for some reason, and I have support at work to continue speaking about these things; and permission to say whatever I feel from the CEO of my company—which is super rare, Not everybody gets that. And it’s a huge privilege, and so I’m not going to waste that privilege. I want to use it to speak up so that we can make improvements. I think the first step is talking about what’s going on and then getting uncomfortable... And then we can move on to fixing it.”</p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">In addition to speaking on diversity and inclusion, Erica advocates expanding access to tech education. She has served as a tech mentor for Black Girls Who Code, served as a Diversity Council Member for over two years, and currently serves on the advisory board for Hack the Hood. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">She has also used her online platform to advance inclusion and diversity in tech. Erica was behind #RealDiversityNumbers, a movement on Twitter to acquire retention numbers and lawsuits for various companies. She also emphasises the importance of  prominent figures using their platform to advance diversity and inclusion. </p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">Erica Baker is a unique role model and voice for women and minorities in tech. She’s a force to be reckoned with, and gives us all hope there will be a place for our skills, enthusiasm and ideas in whatever area of the tech field we choose. </p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"vivian-wong\":[\"/potraits/vivw.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Vivian Wong\",\"Education Executive\"]}}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost16;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost17 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #17\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class = \"blog-title\">Introducing: Natasha Jones, SAP Consultant at Deloitte</h2>\r\n            <p class = \"date\">29th July 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n          Natasha Jones’ journey began with her studies in Marketing and Business Information Systems at university.

I’ve explored STEM and non-STEM subjects in high school, and whilst I enjoy both areas, I was most curious and interested in Technology. My passion in STEM grew from here and I went on to study a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems at University.\r\n          </p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"question\">Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:</p>\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n          After completing my Bachelor’s, I worked in different areas including Operation-driven analytics and Social Media. Then, I joined Deloitte as a Graduate in the SAP Consulting practise almost three years ago. During my time with Deloitte, I have specialised in the design and delivery of modern financial consolidation, budgeting and planning solutions across resource, public, and consumer product industries!\r\n          </p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"question\">Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?</p>\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n          I see myself leading valuable technology-driven transformation programs to help businesses maximise company-wide success.\r\n          </p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"question\"> What do you love about your career now?</p>\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n          I enjoy consulting, designing and delivering transformative solutions that help businesses improve their internal processes and efficiencies. I also love the amount of exposure I get in working with clients  across different industries.\r\n          </p><br/>\r\n\r\n          <p class=\"question\"> Favourite Quote or Motto?</p>\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you will be successful</p>\r\n          <p class=\"post-content\">- E.

I’ve had 2.5 years of industry experience, at KPMG for a year and previously at AECOM in their water team as a civil engineer. I graduated from Sydney University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Civil (Environmental) Engineering, and during my penultimate year at university I was an undergraduate at AECOM in their Urban Systems Advisory team (sustainability planning).\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              In the future I see myself in a role more geared towards combating climate change and building a sustainable future. I maintain a long held interest in environmental justice and climate change, and practice a number of related initiatives in my day to day life. However, I am interested in getting experience across a range of sectors and with different people in the early stages of my career.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What do you love about your career now?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              I love the people that I work with in my current role at KPMG, there is an inclusive culture with friendly people from diverse backgrounds. There are also a wide range of career opportunities both at KPMG and in the wider industry with an engineering background. People value you for your problem solving capability which can be applied to a range of different services.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Why do you think it is important to empower women and increase their involvement in the STEM industry?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              I think it's really important to have diverse teams building solutions together to get the best outcome for people & communities. STEM related industries are responsible for designing many things that each of us use in our day to day lives which affect both females and males. Did you know that when Siri first came out it was 70% more accurate when recognising a males voice than a females, and that female car crash dummies only started being tested in this decade? If females are not in the room then decisions are made without a female perspective, and that affects the female customer base. In the case of the car crash dummies, that's a matter of female safety. It's the same for all different types of diversity. A Harvard study suggests that there needs to be at least 3 in 10 of a minority group in the room to impact a decision being made and according to Engineers Australia 84% of Australian engineering graduates are men, so there is still so much work to do to get females into STEM related careers.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              As I'm early on in my career I am constantly learning. Being ok with not knowing everything all at once or straight away is ok but is something that I am sometimes challenged by.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n            I have been inspired by a range of different people throughout my career so far. My peers inspire me and also senior leaders both inside the organisations I've worked in and outside of these organisations. I take inspiration from those who demonstrate leadership, are passionate about what they do, and have a strong commitment to social and environmental ethics. I also really value mentoring and have been both a mentee and mentor in a number of cases, gaining valuable benefits from both sides.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What are the hard and soft skills that you advised students who are interested in pursuing a similar career path (for internship/graduate role) to upskill on?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Soft skills such as communication, time management and working in a team are really important skills to have in the workforce. The hard skills will come through your degree without really any further work. Coming into the workforce in a STEM career you are hired for your potential and problem solving capability which you would have gained through a STEM related degree. The soft skills are often what you are assessed on throughout graduate recruitment processes - typical questions in a graduate interview for a STEM related graduate role will relate to how you work in a team, how you have managed difficult conversations such as when someone didn't agree with you or how you manage your time. Such skills can be built up by casual work through your time at university (that doesn't need to be STEM related), plus getting involved in volunteering initiatives, university societies and other extracurricular activities.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What is one piece of advice that you would give to your younger self back in university?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Work hard but make time for yourself - hobbies, a casual job, spending time with family and friends.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Favourite Quote or Motto?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Always make time for yourself, no matter how busy you are.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n          authors={{\r\n            \"vivian-wong\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/vivw.jpg\",\r\n              \"profile_img vivw_img\",\r\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\r\n              \"Education Executive\"\r\n            ],\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost21;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost22 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #22\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class=\"blog-title\">\r\n              4 Ways Technology is Changing how we make Art\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p class=\"date\">13th September 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Technology is not all about maths and science.

From working as a software engineering intern at Google in Sydney and California to interning and later working at Palantir Technologies in the UK, she’ll go just about anywhere she can use her software engineering training to solve complex problems. During her training at UNSW, she volunteered her time to share her technical know-how with fellow students and children through Code Create, Tutorial Demonstrator, and Code Like a Girl.

Eventually when it became time to choose a degree it felt like the natural next step to explore engineering. In my first semester of uni I (somewhat luckily) found myself in an introduction to programming course which piqued my interest in the field and set me on the path toward software engineering!\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            \r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Please provide a short summary of your career journey so far:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              In my first year studying software engineering, I started tutoring at UNSW and tutored several subjects throughout my studies. Outside of uni I also volunteered with organisations like Code Like a Girl. During university I had two consecutive internships at Google - the first in Sydney and the second in California. In my final year I had an internship at Palantir in London and am now working as a Forward Deployed Engineer at Palantir in London.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What do you love about your career now? \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              I love the problem solving nature of software engineering, and I am so grateful to be able to do that every day!

By showing these girls and women that they have a community we can help everyone feel welcome doing the work that they love doing, thus diversifying and improving the industry as a whole.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career? \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              The biggest challenge I've faced so far is the feeling that I have started 3 steps behind everyone else and I've had to learn to deal with the feeling that I need to prove myself as an engineer.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Seeing how others have overcome adversity to achieve their goals and pursue their passions is an incredible inspiration to me!\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n         \r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What is one piece of advice that you would give to your younger self back in university? \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Be yourself and don't hold back!\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n         \r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Favourite Quote or Motto?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              “None of us can know what we are capable of until we are tested.” \r\n              <br />- Elizabeth Blackwell\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\r\n          \"vivian-wong\": [\r\n            \"/potraits/vivw.jpg\",\r\n            \"profile_img vivw_img\",\r\n            \"Vivian Wong\",\r\n            \"Education Executive\",\r\n          ],\r\n        }}\r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost23;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost24 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n      <PageHeader\r\n        imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n        title=\"Blog Post #24\"\r\n      />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class=\"blog-title\">\r\n              Sleep and Study \r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p class=\"date\">20th September 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">        \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              In my time at university, I have learnt two things that most students have in common:\r\n              <ol>\r\n                <li>Their devout love for caffeine.</li>\r\n                <li>The fact that at least once, everyone has pulled an all-nighter.</li>\r\n              </ol>             \r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n         \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              And I believed that these two factors were just common aspects of university life. That was until I read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316#:~:text=%22In%20Why%20We%20Sleep%2C%20Dr,with%20our%20sleep%2Ddeprived%20society.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Why We Sleep</i></a> by Matthew Walker. Before this book, I would drink an average of two cups of coffee a day and sleep around 7 hours per night. I led a very active lifestyle and thought that I was pretty on top of my health. What I did not understand was the vast implications of cutting down hours of sleep and how it impacted not only my neurological health but every other facet of my general health. Whilst there is a long list of benefits or lack thereof when you sleep for less than 8 hours, I want to share a secret I learned about the best study hack to ace your exams, and the answer is SLEEP.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              When we sleep, we go through two distinct phases, the first being REM (Rapid-Eye-Movement) Sleep and NREM (Non-Rapid-Eye-Movement) Sleep. REM sleep fuels creativity. It is a time for our brain to connect past experiences and emotions to build a more accurate representation of how our world works. We often hear people say that they need to \"sleep on it\" when contemplating big decisions, or have you ever woken up and the answer to your problems is now at the centre of your mind. Research shows that this problem solving, and creative control arises from REM sleep.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              However, memory consolidation occurs during NREM. In this phase, all the thoughts, ideas, and pieces of information we have stored in our short-term memory (stored in a region of the brain called the hippocampus) are transferred and consolidated to the Cortex. Critically, recalling information from long term memory can only occur if we have fallen asleep. Interestingly, Walker uses the metaphor of sleep, acting as a computer hard drive recovery service salvaging presumably deleted memory files. For instance, facts that we have forgotten soon after learning, such as a name or order of operations are recalled easily upon waking from a good night of sleep, leading to the lightbulb moment.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Additionally, Dr Robert Stickgold, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, conducted a study in which students had to learn a visual memory task through repetition. One group of participants received a good night of sleep (8+ hours) on the day of learning and then tested three days later. They had good memory recall. Another group received a poor night of sleep (less than 8 hours) after learning and were tested three days later (the other nights having sufficient hours of sleep). This group failed to perform the memory task. Thus, Dr Stickgold’s research concluded that it is imperative to receive a good night of sleep after learning for memory consolidation. It does not matter if you catch up on sleep the days after. Memory consolidation is an all or nothing event.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              To sleep 8+ hours the night before a big study day is proven to be incredibly efficient. In doing so, you are emptying and cleaning the slate for the short-term memory centre of the hippocampus to be ready to absorb new information. The hippocampus like a USB has a limited storage capacity and sleep is incredibly important in enabling fact-based learning to occur.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n            The KEY takeaways that I hope you have now gained are:\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>Before exams, aim to sleep for 8 hours! In doing so, you are moving all your information from short term to long term memory, so all the facts needed to ACE your exam are ready to be recalled.</li>\r\n                <li>You need a good night of sleep before your study day to wipe the slate clean and absorb new information.</li>\r\n                <li>Honestly, when in doubt, go to bed and sleep. It is just so good for you and it’s free!</li>\r\n              </ul>  \r\n            </p><br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n            I have now learnt that sleep and study go hand in hand. This book has changed my life, and an all-nighter for me is the thing of the PAST. I hope I have persuaded you to get a full night of sleep.

However, finding events and workshops around campus was difficult and scattered over multiple mediums (UNSW website, Eventbrite, Facebook), and I wondered why there wasn’t an easier way to navigate events on campus.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            How did LinkUp become affiliated with Arc? How did you pitch your idea?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">F: Arc actually reached out to us after seeing our posts on the UNSW Discussion Group! They loved how we were making it easier for students to be involved with uni life and offered their support. It was a great experience working with them.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            Who was on the founding team and what roles did you have allocated? After the project took off, were more people recruited to join the team?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">D: LinkUp started off with me, Zhou and Felicia. I worked mainly on the frontend of the website while Zhou worked on backend and devops. Felicia was in charge of marketing. After a period of growth, yes, we did decide to recruit more members to help LinkUp become an even better product.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            Can you tell us about the process of building LinkUp? What time commitments did it \r\nrequire?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Z: Building LinkUp took a long time. The whole process involved splitting the project into iterations so it was easier to handle, and focused on building MVPs so we could iteratively improve them later on. We experimented with code and features and researched methods and solutions to our problem, which we defined earlier: finding events. We also talked a lot with each other before making decisions. A small part of the project was Googling and using Stack Overflow to find tutorials and code examples that we could use since we were relatively new to personal projects. In terms of time commitment, the project was very flexible and fit within our schedules. Some weeks we might have spent a few hours on it, and others felt like a full-time job (often when we had nothing else to do e.g,. summer holidays). We’ve probably spent well over a few hundred hours so far on LinkUp.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">F: In terms of building our user base and reaching students, we focused on Facebook discussion groups as the easiest way to reach a large number of students.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            What did you learn whilst creating LinkUp?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">D: LinkUp consists of a small and dedicated team, so I learned how to work in a team and the importance of communication and time management to deploy features on time. I also learned to work with external parties to satisfy both Linkup’s needs and theirs. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Z: I learned how to use AWS to host our website, CDN and backend, how to write scripts to scrape websites using Python and set up continuous delivery for our repo. I also learned a bit of React so I could help out with the frontend.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">F: I have definitely developed my teamwork and communication skills along the way, but I also realised how lucky we are at UNSW to have such an active and engaged student community. Society events are a huge part of the uni experience at UNSW, in comparison to other universities, and I’m really grateful for that. It would be amazing if LinkUp could help shape student communities in other unis as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            What are some of the challenges you faced while creating LinkUp?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Z: Probably encountering a bug or error and not being able to find a fix on Google. The best thing to do here is to take a break and refresh your mind for a while, so when you come back, you can take a different approach. Another challenge was finding the motivation to do the project. This might be different for everyone, but I found setting goals and thinking about the future helped me be more motivated in creating LinkUp.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            Who did you turn to for help along the way?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Z: Whenever we needed help, we would either Google it, ask our teammates for help, or ask questions in relevant coding communities available to us. Some supportive communities for asking coding related questions are CSESoc workshops, Pcsoc discord, r/learn programming, and other programming subreddits, a certain UNSW society discord, and plenty of others. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">F: We also have talked to a wonderful mentor from UNSW Founders, who helped guide us and focus on our goals.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            What has been the most rewarding part of creating LinkUp?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">D: Seeing students using LinkUp and receiving feedback about how much it has helped them find events around campus will continue to be the most rewarding part of Linkup. Knowing that other people are also finding value in a project that you spent so much time and effort on will serve as a motivation to improve LinkUp continually.  \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Z: While creating LinkUp, I realised how rewarding a personal project can be and how much you can learn from the experience. Personal projects are completely different from course projects regarding how much control you have over your project. You get to choose your own teammates without any restrictions, have a flexible time commitment that fits in with your schedule, do something you are interested in, plus so many other things. Ultimately, this made it easier to learn the technologies required to build LinkUp and learn what we were interested in. I highly encourage everyone interested in software engineering to start a personal project for something that interests them. There is just so much you can learn from it.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">F: Like Deki, for me, it’s knowing students are using the site and that we’re actually helping strengthen UNSW’s student community. Every time a student or society contacts us with questions or support, it’s super exciting and makes me want to do more.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            What has been the initial impact of LinkUp? Have more students joined societies?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Z: So far we have had 7.7k users and 12k sessions. We’re not too sure of how much we impacted students joining societies, but it has certainly made it easier to find events to go to.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">F: We’ve been impacted a lot by COVID, with many events being postponed or canceled. But, we’ve received a lot of positive feedback, so hopefully, as we move back on campus LinkUp can reach even more people.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            What’s next for LinkUp? What are your plans and goals and will you be pursuing it after \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Z: We hope more students will use LinkUp, so we’re planning to add many features to help make uni events better! We can’t say much yet, but you can expect ways to give feedback for an event and a voting system. We will still maintain it after graduation, depending on how much time we have, but don’t expect any major updates. This should be fine, though, as it doesn’t require much time to maintain.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            What advice would you give to other students who want to pursue a personal project?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">D: If you have a personal project you are interested in, then I would say just start it. If you need help learning the frameworks or languages, there are so many great resources with my personal favourite being Youtube and Codecademy. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">Z: Do something you’re interested in, go to relevant workshops, use your support (founders, CSESOC, WIT, etc,) and have fun.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">F: Think about what you want to achieve and why, write down your goals, and celebrate every victory.\r\n            </p><br/>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n            Deki, Zhou, and Felicia have built something that makes every student’s life easier and more enriching at UNSW. Not many people leave that sort of legacy! Along the way, they developed their technical skills, overcome technical challenges, and explored their interests. And of course, this project showcases their skills in a unique way that will surely be attractive to many employers. On behalf of all UNSW students, thank you Deki, Zhou, and Felicia for volunteering your time to build something we love so much! We hope you will find the knowledge and support you need to reach all your LinkUp goals.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard\r\n        authors={{\"vivian-wong\":[\"/potraits/vivw.jpg\", \"profile_img vivw_img\", \"Vivian Wong\", \"Education Executive\"]}}          \r\n        />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost26;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \".././header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost27 extends Component {\r\n    //start webpage at the top\r\n    componentDidMount() {\r\n        window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n                <PageHeader\r\n                    imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n                    title=\"Blog Post #27\"\r\n                />\r\n                {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n                {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n                <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <h2 class=\"blog-title\">\r\n                            Introducing: Ankita Singh, PHD Student\r\n                        </h2>\r\n                        <p class=\"date\">30th September 2020</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                    <div class=\"post\">\r\n                        <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                            Ankita Singh is a PhD student at UNSW where she is optimising analysis of rocks through techniques and concepts used by Harvard Medical School and the Netherlands Cancer Institute.

During my Bachelor's degree, I have contributed immensely to the UNSW student community in the role of Peer mentor and Petroleum Engineering Student Ambassador, and consequently, was awarded the 'Engineering Student Service Award'. Since then, I am pursuing doctoral studies at UNSW School of Minerals and Energy Resources Engineering with a focus on image analysis, data science, and rocks. To keep myself updated with the energy industry, I have also had internships at Woodside Energy in Perth.  Finally, I look forward to finishing my doctoral studies in 2020 and be more involved with the energy industry to contribute to a greener and cleaner future.\r\n                        </p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"question\">\r\n                            Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                            I really believe that the more exposure one has to real-world problems, the better one can contribute to the community and think out-of-box. As I finish my doctoral studies, I aim to get a 360-degree experience in petroleum, mining, renewable, and data science industries. The need to gain experience in this quadra-combo will guide my future career roles in the short to medium term. \r\n                        </p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"question\">What do you love about your career now?</p>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                            I absolutely love that I learn something new every day. As a doctoral student, you learn to never give up and tackle the same problem in so many different ways that it will amaze you how thinking differently and collaborating can lead to great innovations. Looking at my career in a broader sense, being a part of such a diverse energy and resources industry, thrills me every day because there is a vision that I can live up to and that is to be able to bring electricity to those households who are currently deprived of such luxuries.\r\n                        </p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"question\">What are the challenging aspects of your career?</p>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                            In the last few years, we have all witnessed that technology has developed and progressed at a lightning speed. From a business perspective, implementing some of these outstanding technologies has been challenging in the mining and petroleum industry. This is even the case when we know that we need it to keep the costs low and be more efficient. Therefore, I think being able to use state-of-the-art data science and cloud computing technologies to bring in the value to the companies is a big challenge.  More so, there are multiple avenues to improve performance and address issues such as climate change and human rights policies that help the energy companies operate in harmony with everyone.\r\n                        </p><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"question\">How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your career?</p>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                            My family is my biggest inspiration.

They are crucial for helping recruiters understand a potential employee's set of practical skills and whether or not their way of thinking is compatible with the company. In this Q&A, Vivian Shen and Amanda Li, the President and Vice President of WIT respectively, offer the useful advice they have gathered from their own experiences to help you succeed in your next technical interview.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <ol class=\"list\">\r\n              <li class=\"question\">Can you tell us about yourself?</li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                <strong>Vivian(V)</strong>: I'm Vivian, and I’m currently studying B. Data Science & Decisions (Computational Major). I am the current President of WIT and formerly the Treasurer of CSE Revue. I was a Google STEP Intern last summer, and I will be an Atlassian Data Science Intern this Summer.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                <strong>Amanda(A)</strong>: I’m Amanda, and I’m a third-year student studying Software and Biomedical Engineering. I’ve been a part of a few societies and Arc Volunteering. I am currently the VP for WIT and the Careers Director for EngSoc. I started applying for internships this year, and I’m interning at AI Australia as a Web Dev. This summer, I’ll be an Atlassian Software Developer Intern.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">How have you prepared for technical interviews?</li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: I brushed up on common data structures and algorithms, including time and space complexities, using university resources from COMP2521, Medium articles and Youtube videos. I practiced by doing questions on websites such as HackerRank and LeetCode. Additionally, I browsed on Reddit and other forums to understand the interview process and what types of questions I might be asked for a specific interview. After I felt like I was prepared enough, I had a couple of our friends sit through mock technical interviews with me and give me feedback on my performance.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                A: I researched people's past experiences interviewing for the company and role, especially on forums like Reddit, Glassdoor and Quora. People often describe their interview process, how they found it (difficulty level) and what types of questions they were asked. I also knew that they would be assessing data structure and algorithms, so I revisited my COMP2521 notes.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">Where did you find practice questions? </li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: I found many practice questions on HackerRank and Leetcode.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                A: Typical sites are HackerRank and Leetcode. HackerRank is great because it provides verified solutions in multiple languages and tagged topics and difficulty levels. Questions also have some test cases given. Additionally most companies use platforms like HackerRank for their coding test stages so it’s good to familiarise yourself with the setup. Another website you could try is InterviewBit. They have video tutorials on topics and hand-picked questions. You also get rated with a points system and if you excel you get referred to top-notch companies.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">What was the structure of the technical interviews you completed?</li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: The structure of technical interviews would differ depending on the company and role you've applied to. Today, we're going to go over the most common structure of technical interviews for a <strong>software engineering role</strong>.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                The typical interview is ~45 minutes long. We begin with self-introductions for the first ~5 minutes. Here's your opportunity to tell the interviewer a little bit about yourself, your motivations for applying to this role and what experiences you have (from other internships, hackathon, personal projects etc). Next we would spend the next 30-35 minutes answering technical questions and wrap-up with ~5 minutes of questions you would like to ask the interviewer.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                For the technical questions, you should expect to be given either 1 hard question or 2 easy-medium questions for you to CODE up in the 30-35 minutes. Following this, you will always be asked about the time and space complexity of your code. You should always begin by understanding the question asked. Spend the next 2-3 minutes asking any clarifying questions (addressing input/output types, asking how it might handle certain edge cases) and think of test cases and confirming their intended output. Then, you can think about your code implementation and verbalize how you intend to implement the code. After the interviewer has given you the 'green light' you should begin by choosing your coding language and start coding it up.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                A: I’ve only done 1 technical interview and it was actually 55 minutes and one part of a three hour session. There was a brief introduction (there was only one interviewer) and then we jumped into the problem-solving and ended off with around 5 minutes of questions for the interviewer too. Most people answer 2 - 3 questions (easy-medium difficulty). The platform used was CodePair which lets you and your interviewer collaboratively code. The interview gave one question at a time, I would code, test and then be asked ways to optimise my implementation based on space and time complexity.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">How did you test your code in your interviews?</li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: For the technical interviews I sat, they were usually done on a whiteboard or on CoderPad. Either way, they don't let you 'run' your code. You can 'test' your code by thinking of edge cases and seeing how your code handles it, or how you can adjust your code to handle this case.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                A: My technical interview was online/virtual so I could actually run my code within the online coding platform but the testing process is the same - you would input test cases (consider edge cases and error cases if any) and compare the output.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">What are some of the questions/topics you were asked?</li>\r\n\r\n              <div class=\"img-box outer-box\">\r\n                <div class=\"inner-box\">\r\n                  <img\r\n                  src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/blog-attachments/blog-28-topics-1.jpg\"}\r\n                  alt=\"techInterviews-1\"\r\n                  resizeMode=\"contain\"\r\n                  />\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: Another thing you also want to be familiar with is the libraries of your chosen language eg. Python would have a number of existing functions. If you wanted to translate all the lower cases to upper cases you can use the inbuilt string.upper() to handle this instead of coding it up from scratch. This is important since it would tell the interviewer how well you know the language and it would also make your code <em>pythonic</em>, aligning with the Python style guides.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                A: I was told to revise on data structures and algorithms (not necessarily the names but how to apply them) before my interview. The questions I received were on manipulation of arrays, strings and binary.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">Which language did you use and how did you decide to use that language? </li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: Code in the language you are most <b>comfortable</b> in. At UNSW most students would begin by learning C, which is arguably not the best language to sit your technical interviews in. However, if you feel that C is your strongest language, then by all means sit your interview in C. I sat my Google STEP interviews in C and passed, and I know many other UNSW students who did the same for their roles and got accepted too.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                A: I’ve been coding with Python for all my coding tests and technical interviews. It’s what I’m most comfortable with and there’s just some things (e.g. data structures) that are quicker and easier to implement in Python than C (even though C was my first language). For general software developer interviews, they usually choose questions that can be answered in a range of languages, so if you only know one language like C, that’s fine - it just might take longer to answer. However, if you are applying for a role with a specific language (e.g. C# Developer), then your coding tests will most likely require you to code in that language.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">How did you communicate your thought process / code implementation to the interviewer?</li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: You want to verbalise your thought process to the interview as you code. This is actually a lot harder than you think because we're not used to doing this. You should definitely take the chance to practice a couple of mock interviews with friends or at society events such as WIT where you can practice technical interviews with company representatives.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"psot-content\">\r\n                A: Even with uni exams, I tend to write my plan of attack in comments first (e.g. sort through this, loop through this then find this). So during the interview, I would also be saying it aloud too. Having those comments down just helps me target each step of solving the question one by one (e.g. first I have to sort, how do I sort, what’s the smartest way to sort).\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">What questions would you recommend asking the interviewer?</li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: You should ask the interviewer about things you would want to know about the company. Instead of the cliched, \"Tell me about your role\" or \"How are you enjoying your work\", think about what you would want to know about the company/role before you go in.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                I’m pretty sure I asked the typical “What projects do you work on” but just because I was genuinely curious. I think it’s ok to start off by asking these things but not just filler questions - ask them if you actually want to know. That way, when they reply, there will be particular parts that interest you which you can ask more about. My interviewer was a backend developer but I’m more interested in frontend so I asked about how the different sides interacted, how tasks are separated/delegated, why he chose backend and difference between intern and grad application process.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">Did you ever get a question you didn’t know how to answer? If yes, what did you do?</li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: Yes definitely. In interviews, you should always expect to answer questions you have never seen or heard of. You just need to think about how you would try to solve this with what knowledge you have and push through. Something that worked for me was to begin by how I would solve it logically without code and then seeing how that would translate into code.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                A: Yes I have, even in coding tests. I got stuck at one point when he asked me how I would optimise my code in terms of space complexity. I threw around suggestions of ways I could change the data structure / algorithm I used. Not going to lie, I was stalling for time to think but also hoped bouncing ideas off him would help me see if I was going in the right direction. He actually gave me a hint to point me in the right direction, and I ended up getting it.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">What were some of the differences between the interview process at different companies? </li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                V: For a software engineering role, the interview process would differ in terms of number of interviews, assessment days as well as types of questions etc.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                Some companies such as Atassian would send through a HackerRank test to help filter out applicants before they get to proceed to a technical interview. Whereas other companies such as Facebook would go straight into technical interviews.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                For Canva, you get to pick if you want to sit through a back-end or front-end interview, and your interview questions would be specifically on these areas instead of the usual data structure and algorithm questions.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                Sometimes companies who don't have a Sydney office such as Jane Street would also fly you out to their office for a final assessment day (usually 3 consecutive interviews in one day).\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                A: For Atlassian, you would also experience a final assessment day usually in office but online due to COVID this year with 3 interviews in a row (technical interview with a whiteboard interview and values interview).\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                That being said, the interview processes do differ slightly for each company in terms of structure, format and questions. If the interview process is unclear, you should definitely clarify this with your HR point of contact.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <li class=\"question\">What tips for success in technical interviews do you have for others?</li>\r\n              <br /> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"red-cross\">&#10060;</span> Don't leave it to the last minute - usually technical interviews aren't something you can prepare for the night before.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"red-cross\">&#10060;</span> Don't begin your studies by working on the hard questions first, start at a level you're comfortable with and then work your way up.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"red-cross\">&#10060;</span> If you encounter a problem you weren’t prepared for, don’t freak out and give up immediately.

I continued on as a full time developer at Atlassian, working on products that enabled all kinds of teams and developers. I grew fond of big tech companies, but decided to take a leap of faith and joined a fast growing startup called Eucalyptus where I am now the Engineering Team Lead. We've built pilot.com.au and kinfertility.com.au and I'm absolutely loving working in telehealth.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            \r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Where do you see yourself in the future (career wise)?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              I feel like I've changed a lot in the past few years, and I still have a lot to learn and grow into.

Diverse teams really enrich the pool of ideas that are possible and has resulted in some exciting innovations in STEM.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What are the challenging aspects of your career? \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Imposter syndrome is a huge one and always kicks in every now and again. The nature of working in STEM involves facing new challenges, hard problems and many unknowns, and from that can arise a feeling of self doubt. But, you just need to remember that being scared is better than feeling comfortable, and that doubt most likely comes from a place of passion and wanting to do your best.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              How have others inspired you at different periods throughout your career?\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              There have been so many people throughout my journey that have been instrumental in shaping me today.

These data structures only store unique values. In Python, we can use a dictionary to store all the elements we’ve seen before. As we loop through our array, if our current element has appeared in the array before, it would be stored in ‘seen’ and hence we have found our duplicate. \r\n              </p>\r\n              < br />\r\n              <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n                Python has built-in functions and libraries so take advantage of those instead of writing your own lengthy algorithms.

What lies within the murky depths of this commonly uttered buzzword, and how has it unknowingly intertwined itself with our existing day to day life?\r\n            </p> <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n            Broadly speaking, fintech refers to the use of technology and innovation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional financial services. Although often portrayed as niche specialism, fintech encapsulates a range of subcategories, from cryptocurrencies and mobile payments, to lending.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n            Cryptocurrency\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital assets that are often designed to be a medium of exchange. These currencies are often based upon blockchain technology, which provides a more transparent way of tracking the life cycle of a financial transaction, thus eliminating the need for a third party (i.e. banks) to be present when transferring funds. Due to the decentralized and distributed nature of cryptocurrencies, in conjunction with the disablement of government manipulation, they foster a deeper level of customer confidence.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Lendtech\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Lendtech refers to digital platforms that facilitate a more streamlined approach to matching lenders with borrowers. Lendtech platforms utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to verify credentials, match borrowers to lenders, and predict a suitable interest rate. The rise of lendtech has created a space for borrowers with lower credit ratings to have the ability to obtain loans, while more pro-risk lenders have the chance to recoup higher returns.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Paytech\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              With PayPal, AfterPay, ZipPay, and many others becoming peripheral actors in our online shopping regimes, the new digitized way of spending has incorporated itself seamlessly into our everyday lives. Beneath the surface of a more convenient checkout, Paytech integrates its digital platform with expansive networks to create more efficient digital connectivity for its customers.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Mobile Payments\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n            Fintech has further facilitated the streamlining of the payment process through mobile payments such as Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and more. The creation of digital wallets eliminates the barriers and inefficiencies associated with traditional means of payment, removing the unnecessary resources required for cash payments. Furthermore, mobile payments improve customer service by analyzing trends in purchase history information, making the relationship between the seller and buyer more personalized than ever.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              The Future and Beyond\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              So what does the rise of fintech mean for us?\r\n            </p><p class=\"post-content\">\r\n            As users, we can now enjoy a more efficient transaction process, with real-time payments, easier access to credit, and a higher level of service. The banking sector, however, is facing a different story. Thousands of new and up and coming fintech start-ups are offering products and services that were traditionally encompassed by traditional players in the banking industry. While there will be losses in some areas, namely routine and easily automatable tasks, these will be recouped through a culture of innovation and collaboration. With most banks having a deep and thorough understanding of financial services, as well as generations of consumer trust, fintech companies are centered around employees from a background other than finance. Thus, a collaborative effort between the up and coming financial technology sector and the traditional finance industry will carve the future towards a more equitable, and accessible financial services industry.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard authors={{\r\n            \"jane-wang\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/jane-wang.png\",\r\n              \"profile_img vivw_img\",\r\n              \"Jane Wang\",\r\n              \"Events Team\",\r\n            ],\r\n        }} />\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost32;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost33 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader\r\n          imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n          title=\"Blog Post #33\"\r\n        />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class=\"blog-title\">\r\n              WCW ~ ALL WIT Exec Team 2020\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p class=\"date\">21st October 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What sparked your interest to study a STEM degree?  \r\n            </p> \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <strong>Amanda</strong>: I always knew I wanted to have a job that had both a creative and analytical/logical side and studying software was the perfect combination of the two, being able to design and implement products. Technology also interested me because it’s a field where you have to constantly learn and adapt as the fast-paced industry evolves, meaning you’ll never be bored. I also chose engineering, particularly biomedical, to accompany software because I knew I wanted a career which creates a positive impact on the world, and helps others enjoy a better standard of living. \r\n            </p><br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Where do you see yourself in the future?\r\n            </p> \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <strong>Elizabeth</strong>: In the near future (5 years or so) I still see myself working in a software engineering role hopefully doing something that is still challenging and something I can learn from. I don’t particularly foresee being in a managerial position however I do see myself mentoring others who are just starting their STEM careers because I am passionate about inspiring others to pursue their interests and also encouraging others to see what is beyond just the traditional software engineering role. I also have many aspirations outside my career such as travelling so I hope that I can also achieve those goals as well!\r\n            </p><br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What is your favourite aspect of being part of WIT Exec Team 2020\r\n            </p> \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <strong>Vivian Wong</strong>: I loved how I could get involved in other portfolios, and I was part of the organising committee for Flagship events such as the WIT Hackathon, WIT Industry mentoring program and Case Crack. WIT gave me the opportunity to write the mark scheme and be the moderator for the Hackathon, be the MC of events and attend meetings with sponsors, as well as other societies. This really allowed me to develop myself personally and professionally, and I was able to apply the skills that I learned from the WIT experience into other societies and work. WIT has opened up a world of opportunities for me, allowing me to meet people from diverse backgrounds who are ambitious and passionate about the same thing as I am.\r\n            </p><br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Who are your personal inspirations and heroes?\r\n            </p> \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <strong>Kelly</strong>: From a young age, I was always awed by my mother’s perseverance and diligence. As a first generation immigrant, she is the founder of her very own computer hardware startup, Dotsmart. Thinking back, I witnessed years of her managing her company, learning new and challenging skills that was critical in striving for a better future. Thus, I am also trying to take a page out of her book: “if you work hard on something, someday you will be an expert at it.”\r\n            </p><br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What is a piece of advice that you would give to your younger self?\r\n            </p> \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <strong>Gabby</strong>: Something that my younger self and current self constantly needs reminding is the importance of prioritising tasks and commitments, and to never forget to prioritise your mental and physical health first. As an intrinsically competitive person, it's so important to remind yourself that we can only forge our own futures by competing with the expectations that we hold to ourselves, not others - so avoid spiralling down the rabbit hole of LinkedIn, you are on your way to where you should be.\r\n            </p><br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What was the greatest challenge you faced?

As I slowly transition into the workforce,  I cannot help but experience the “Imposter Syndrome”. With all this talent Among Us, I irrationally fear that others will suspect me as an Imposter. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              However, I’m not alone. The only way to overcome feeling like a fraud is to recognise that you are not one. Don’t devalue your worth and undermine your experience - if you focus on your strengths, destiny will take you where you are most needed. \r\n            </p><br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              What’s a motto or quote you live by?\r\n            </p> \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <strong>Vivian Shen</strong>: Be the change you seek. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              This is something I live by and I feel so strongly about. It really helps me stay focused, driven and create something that will add value and be a positive influence on people’s lives.There’s always something you can improve that might not be apparent to others. and in times like this it’s extremely important to take the first step towards change. \r\n            </p><br />\r\n          \r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              How do you stay inspired and creative?

Any time I’ve got a creative block, I ask for advice and feedback to get a fresh perspective. In the same vein, working with others is the biggest driver for me - knowing that I have expectations to meet and succeed, and a team to support and push each other.\r\n            </p><br />     \r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              How has technology influenced you in becoming who you are today?\r\n            </p> \r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <strong>Elicia</strong>: Technology lies at the forefront of almost everything I do. Its influence lies in its power to connect people, information, and stories across the globe. From reading books and listening to music to sharing photos with friends and family, it all feels like an extension of myself as I share my passions and interests with others.

Change is inevitable and at every milestone we achieve there’s an uncertainty about the future and nostalgia of passed time. Through my roles within societies, my degree and work the lesson has been that change brings opportunities and unpredictability. If we do not take the chance to embrace the unknown, we will never know if we will succeed or not. Adapting to uncertainty is key in understanding ourselves in future.\r\n            </p><br />   \r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*for the blog post author*/}\r\n        <AuthorCard authors={{\r\n            \"vivian-wong\": [\r\n              \"/potraits/vivw.jpg\",\r\n              \"profile_img vivw_img\",\r\n              \"Vivian Wong\",\r\n              \"Education Executive\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }}/>\r\n        {/*End of blog posts*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default blogPost33;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport \".././style.css\";\r\nimport \"./blog-post.css\";\r\nimport AuthorCard from \"./authorCard\";\r\nimport PageHeader from \"../header\";\r\n\r\nclass blogPost34 extends Component {\r\n  //start webpage at the top\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {/* Cover Photo */}\r\n        <PageHeader\r\n          imgUrl=\"/blog-header.png\"\r\n          title=\"Blog Post #34\"\r\n        />\r\n\r\n        {/*End of Header*/}\r\n\r\n        {/*Start of blog post*/}\r\n        <div class=\"blog-content\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class=\"blog-title\">\r\n              What I Learnt From Shadiyah Lim\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p class=\"date\">25th October 2020</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div class=\"post\">\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n            Co-hosting the very first Careers Deep Dive episode of our Talk WIT Us podcast, I was lucky enough to chat to Shadiyah Lim, an Innovation Advisory Consultant at AWS. Surprisingly, as we’d quickly learned, she hasn’t always been in the Digital Transformation industry. Shadiyah graduated with a communications and media studies degree, spent two years teaching English in South Korea, and began work as a writer before ever stepping foot into her current industry. Of course, she was bursting with experience and advice to share during our chat, but some amazing lessons stuck out.\r\n            </p> <br /><br />\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              It’s okay when things don’t go to plan.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <em>“[I graduated] during the Global Financial Crisis, so I was teaching English in Seoul because I couldn’t find a job at the time. I wanted to go back to the States, but it was still pretty hard to find a job. I came to Australia where I could live and work for a year. And that year turned into ten.”</em>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Shadiyah’s struggle to find a job after graduating during the Global Financial Crisis struck similarities with the pandemic situation we currently find ourselves in. Just like with the GFC ten years ago, our lives have been upended by circumstances outside of our control. For companies struggling to stay afloat, graduate opportunities are the last thing on their mind, and there is not much that we as students can do about that. Inevitably, even fully qualified graduates like Shadiyah ten years ago, can be left without a company that will offer them a place.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Even though I have a few years left at uni, I can’t pretend that I haven’t been a little anxious that jobs will still be in short supply when I graduate, and that doesn’t even compare to how tough it is for the students graduating this year. Despite these struggles, Shadiyah turned a difficult situation into new opportunities that have led her to the successful career that she has today. So even though we might be currently living in a pandemic, it’s important to realize that this situation won’t last forever.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Her experience is a timely reminder that even when things don’t go to plan, there are other pathways to find. If Shadiyah had found a job directly after graduating, would she have found herself in South Korea, or with a successful career in the tech industry in Australia? Likewise, for us, we could discover new pathways that lead to something which we couldn’t have imagined otherwise.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Don’t be afraid to put your hand up.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <em>“Be the person who isn’t afraid to put your hand up. Think big. Go for opportunities.”\r\n              </em>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              When we asked Shadiyah for her last words of advice to our listeners, it’s no wonder she encouraged us to tenaciously pursue opportunities. Hearing about how she moved from a writer to a product owner at CBA without a traditional tech background, it’s clear that these accomplishments came about by willingly stepping up to challenges and going beyond what was expected of her.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              It’s easy to pre-empt failure and shy away from taking on the challenges we face. Shadiyah emphasised the need to ask the people around her for help when she was stuck, and the continual learning she undertook. It’s about looking at challenges with a growth mindset, because even when we do fail, we have gained important lessons, and these lessons have great power in helping us the next time we put our hands up.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              The future is at the intersection of business and technology. \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <em>“Technology is ever-changing, so our customers' wants and needs, as well as business’s wants and needs… If you can bridge technical understanding with business and customer understanding, that is gold.”</em>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              The intersection of business and technology is at the heart of what Shadiyah does as an Innovation Advisory Consultant at AWS. She believes it is also at the heart of businesses moving forwards.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              Coming from a more technical background myself, I’ve usually been interested in tech for its own sake. This opened my eyes to the fact that to a business, its greatest value is in its ability to help address its customers’ needs. In that sense, technology innovation can’t exist in its own bubble. Businesses and customers need to benefit from these innovations, and we can only achieve that with an understanding of both tech capabilities and business needs.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"question\">\r\n              Recruiters look for someone who can inspire a team.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              <em>“When I’m interviewing, I’m always looking for someone who can demonstrate they were able to bring clarity to a situation, they were able to make the people around them very confident, they were able to build trust and attract desire to progress that initiative further.”</em>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              We were super lucky that Shadiyah could offer a recruiter’s perspective on the skills and attributes that she looks for in a potential employee. What she said wasn’t quite what I expected to hear from a recruiter.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              I’ve heard plenty of times that employers are looking for someone who takes initiative and is a capable problem solver. However, Shadiyah suggests that it takes more than being able to solve problems on your own. It’s about being able to inspire others to believe in your solutions as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              This is a skill that can be developed by actively participating in teamwork, whether that be at uni or outside of it. Following her advice from earlier, putting your hand up to more challenges also creates more opportunities to solve problems alongside other people, and thus, the opportunity to inspire them as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              These lessons all add up to an overarching theme: that anything is possible with the right mindset and an openness to learn. Shadiyah embodied this attitude, and her energy was completely infectious. Particularly in the uncertainty of a global pandemic, this belief is more important than ever. With this in mind, the future holds opportunities for all of us, as long as we take the initiative to find them.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-content\">\r\n              For more
