Jane: Hey everyone, welcome to the first episode of the WIT podcast Chat and Chill! yayy! Just to kick off, I’ll give a brief introduction to WIT: so Women in Technology is a student run society that was formed in 2016 that aims to empower and up-skill students in STEM. We do this through running a range of social, educational and professional events, with a lot of exciting events happening in T3: so keep your eyes peeled for things like our Datathon and Case Crack! So today we’re joined by 4 wonderful guests from WIT, so let’s start by giving a brief introduction of ourselves before we dive into the questions - I’ll start us off - Hi everyone, I’ll be hosting today, I’m Jane, and I’m a second year studying comm infs, and I’m currently part of the events subcom at WIT!

Vivian S: Hi I’m Vivian Shen, I’m currently 3rd year studying a Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions with a computational major, and I’m the President, I manage all the teams, create strategic plans and direction for our society. So that just looks at creating events or initiatives that add value or create opportunities for our members. So that’s me!

Amanda: Hi everyone, I’m Amanda, I’m 3rd year Software Engineering/Biomedical Engineering and I’m the VP of WIT for 2020, so I’m just 2nd in command, you know, the peanut butter to the jelly to our president.

Nishmi: Hi everyone, my name is Nishmi, I’m also a second year student at UNSW, doing a double degree in Commerce and Advanced Science and my role in WIT is being part of the events subcom so essentially we look at the nitty gritty details of organising events, deciding which events should be tailored to our students and at which time, so it's looking at the really exciting stuff.

Jane: OK great, thanks for introducing yourselves everyone, so let’s get stuck into the questions. So with the whole coronavirus situation, a lot of first years haven’t really had that traditional taste of campus life that we all had, so let’s letting them live vicariously, so can you give some insight into the things that you did in first year that really helped you integrate yourself into campus life, or any mistakes/things you wish you did in first year looking back?

Vivian S: Yeah ok, so I guess something that is really quite important to know about UNSW is that we do have quite a very big campus life and culture. So all the societies are really well run and do have their own kinda established culture. So coming to uni, there are tens and thousands of people for you to meet, and university is a really great opportunity for you to kinda, meet new people and make new friends. So you can do this by joining societies, attending society and university run events. I know this is quite important because everything is run online right now but you can definitely take the opportunity to attend the online events and make friends and stuff like that, so yeah, I guess making friends is important for a lot of reasons, but not gonna go through all of them today, so I guess we’ll just say what’s quite important, so it does drive our social life, but there is also a lot of career related opportunities you can kinda to learn from your friends as well. And you should also take advantage of all the UNSW I guess resources such as counselling, or free mock interviews or resume checks that really helps in the career/professional aspect as well. And there’s a whole list of things I think you shouldn’t do in first year as well. Uhm.. haha.. So I guess I do have a couple of friends who staying in their high school friendship group and as cliche as it might sound, I think university if a time of self discovery and you just won’t grow as much if you don’t take the time to expand your social group and I think like coming into university, I think a lot of people do have this kinda like Ps get degrees mindset, but you’ll actually find out that you’ll miss out on a lot of opportunities when you go on, and when you are in your early years, you’re doing comparatively easier courses where it is easier to get better grades, so you should be setting standards for yourself and doing your best to meet them and just because your friends want to cruise through university, it doesn’t meant that you should compromise and lower your standards and also don’t get swept up into peer pressure, don’t do something you’re not comfortable doing, just because everyone is doing something, it doesn’t mean it’s right, and it doesn't mean you should bend your morals or values to assimilate. That’s from me.

Amanda: yeah so I also agree, I think joining societies really helped me to really experience the whole variety of uni life and uni culture and that’s where I met a lot of my friends as well, but I only started doing that in second year, so I do wish that I started applying for events in first year as well. I was also really scared to go to career related events especially networking stuff because when you go into uni that’s your first taste of it - I was so scared to go into that - I don’t know what to say to industry - I’m only first year, I don’t have to care about my career just yet, but the sooner you start the more time you have to prepare - you’re going to be doing that for the rest of your life - you’re going to going to networking events, so the sooner you start, the more prep you have essentially. I also agree about caring about your academics. I think it’s important to find a balance in your first year - you’re adjusting your life to this new environment and new situation, so just balancing your social life but also keeping your academics up. Yeah, step outside your comfort zone, go to events, try new things, don’t be afraid - that’s what I would say to my first year self.

Nishmi: I definitely agree with everyone in terms of the fact that people should be caring about their education, caring about their social life, their professional life and you know developing as many skills as possible before the end of uni but I also think that students take their time into thinking about what they need to develop before jumping into all these programs and societies just to kinda figure out where you want to go, what you actually want to do with your degree and your life and your time at uni. I think that’s really important just because I think if you straight up dive into all these societies and events and networking nights, it definitely does give you the experience to develop yourself professionally, but it also can create confusion sometimes as to what you actually want to do and that essentially can create doubt in what you want to do - so taking your time into figuring out is also very important and I think your first year should be kinda focussed around that as well.

Jane: Ok great, thanks for all that advice guys, I’m sure our listeners will find that all very valuable - so moving on, so with everything being online, making friends or really feeling like you’re part of a university culture is probably a lot tougher than it already is - any advice to students who are struggling to immerse themselves with university life?

Amanda: Yeah so I think so right now because everything is online, UNSW discussion group that’s kinda where all the UNSW kids are congregating, so I think being aware of what’s happening through that page, you can see all the memes and stuff, feel a little included, and you’ll also be aware of a lot of the events that a lot of societies are holding, social ones, career ones, the whole range and yeah if you feel a bit lonely or want to make new friends, you can come to an event, everyone is really open and welcoming so you can just pop up to an event, go talk to some people, make some friends and maybe those connections will last despite the quarantine.

Viv S: So I definitely agree with what Amanda said, kinda just like being a bit more active socially and also going to society events and whatnot. I think there's also an opportunity to make friends within your tutorials and classes as well, and now that everything's online I know it’s really easy to miss a lecture or tutorial every week, and fast track to exams and you’ve realised that you’ve missed all your classes, so I think in your tutorial there are like times where you can engage with some of the other students and I think for anyone- if you think you want to talk to them or want to get to know more about them and they are somehow in the same class as you, then I think you should take the opportunity to like go up to them and maybe share notes and that's how you keep yourself accountable to stay on top of your things and making sure your new friend is at the same level as well.

Jane: Yeah that’s really good advice. Just adding on to that, not plug WIT, but a really good way to meet people is through joining things like case comps, and WIT will be holding a case crack in term 3 so you can sign up as an individual and we can put you into a group, and that’s a really good way to make friends and meet people because you’re kinda bonding over a shared experience, yeah so keep your eyes peeled for that.

Viv S: yep definitely.

Jane: Since all of us here as part of the podcast - we’re all 2nd year - let’s take a wander down memory lane - what was the first ever extracurricular that you took part in during university, and how did that change your perspective on what you could achieve during this time?

Nishmi: I think for me it was when I was volunteering at the WIT stall at the beginning of the year during O-week - I think that really snowballed a huge change in my life just because by volunteering at that stall people told me that I should try to the WIT society, try to get into whatever role I wanted and that’s how I ended up here, and if I didn’t then I wouldn’t be signing up for all these opportunities that WIT is offering, that other societies are offering, that the uni is offering, different companies are offering. I don’t think I would have had the confidence or the ability to professionally do that and another big change that WIT has allowed me to do is that I’m making so many new friends, met so many wonderful people through the society and through the sponsors, and through the people that attend our events, and all these connections are really valuable, not just in a professional sense, but even the amount of support that we get from being in a society, so I think that was a major part of my life especially this year.

Viv S: Yeah, kinda just adding on for me, my first student society was the Computer Science and Engineering Revue. And I guess I was quite surprised, because I thought it was just a society about putting on a show, acting, singing whatnot, but I was honestly so much more than that and I feel like I was quite surprised about that - like how talented and dedicated everyone was in the society, and all student societies are doing it for good reason but we do invest heaps of time into what we create because we do see value in it. So I think being part of Revue definitely helped me grow as a person, kinda made me realise what it means to be a part of something that is bigger than yourself because Revue is actually a really big society - we do involve I think like a good 100 people, just operating and running the show altogether so you are part of something bigger than yourself as well - and made me realise that student societies are what you make of it, if you do set your own goals you want to meet, then you’ll definitely grow, but if you just step into it thinking like oh yeah it’s just going to be another thing on my resume, that’s not the right mindset to have, and conversely you won’t be able to get as much value out of the experience. So I guess like for me, student societies are a great way to learn and develop skills such as collaborating in a team, managing conflict and also building relationships, and because I value the work I do in my student societies and dedicate all this time to it - I definitely get a lot of value out of it too, so that’s definitely how a student society can change your perspective and whatnot.

Amanda: So my first extracurricular was event horizon which is kinda an ARC thing not that much of a society, but what they do is they just kinda plan events around uni, they participate in stress less week and that sort of stuff. It changed my perspective on uni life because I just assumed it would be like high school clubs but there’s a lot more social aspect to it - because you’re like working on bigger things, you end up naturally becoming closer to people, I guess my first taste of societies were EngSoc and WIT at the same time, and having those two societies showed me different sides of what being in a society could be like and I got to like learn different things from being in those two as well so in WIT because I under externals, I got to like focus on like how to email sponsors, how to plan events in general, how to communicate my ideas concisely without issues coming up, or miscommunication, or not being too long in what I’m trying to say, and EngSoc helped me on that as well, just more on the event planning side. It made me realise that if you work in a team, and if you have a common goal, you can achieve things really quickly, and knowing, if issues come up, knowing how to adapt and adjust - that’s the most important thing I learnt.

Jane: Okay cool, thanks for all of those insights, just adding a bit about extra-curricular. My first extracurricular experience was with WIT this year, in my first year I wasn’t part of any university extra-curricular, but I did take in volunteering outside of uni, so for any students in their first year, maybe you missed out on subcom recruitment, or didn’t get in, just keep in mind there are so many opportunities out there, even outside of societies, like what Amanda mentioned, there are so many types of ARC volunteering, that you can join where you can meet so many great people, or like organisations that you can join outside of university that also provide you with a lot of professional development, and you get to meet a wide range of people there. Okay, I know a lot of students are keen beans and want to join as many things as possible - would you suggest students take on multiple extra-curricular activities, or join multiple societies? Why or why not?

Nishmi: I think for sure, I mean if you’re interested in multiple societies and what they do, and are interested in interested in joining the subcom or becoming an exec, you should definitely try and put yourself out there to join those extra societies, or participate in those extracurricular activities, because they build a lot of experience and knowledge and not only in a professional sense but you also get to meet so many new people, and you get to be exposed to different ways of thinking, and overall you’re just making so many new connections and so many new friends and it’s a great way to develop your social life if you’re looking into that, or develop your professional life if you're looking into that as well. It just depends on what you’re looking for and what you’re interested in but if you’re considering just staying in one society, that’s also perfectly okay, mainly because you need to focus on what you want to do and how you’re going to achieve that, and just on top of that, even with uni, your academic life, sometimes it can get really hectic and really busy, so you might consider your workload, and not join more societies and more extracurricular activities, it’s just based on your personal preferences, and how much time you’ve got on your hands and what you’re willing to do with that time.

Viv S: So I definitely agree with what everything was said here, I also do want to point out something Nishmi said, just about balancing your social and also your university studies and whatnot. So I do think it is important when you are considering taking on multiple extracurricular or societies or whatnot, you do want to be considering if you can actually commit to it. Societies are about a lot more than just doing the assigned work, it is about the people you meet, and the culture as well, so make sure that when you’re joining a new society, you can accommodate for the time commitment and stuff like that, also also making sure that you do balance it, making sure that even though your are involved in all these extra-curriculars, you are leaving time aside to do like professional job hunting throughout university, and to commit to any part-time work applicable and whatnot. Also something quite important to note is that we shouldn’t limit it to only student societies and extracurricular activities and whatnot, UNSW has a lot of great programs like Founders Program, Heroes etc. as well as looking at industry programs, like accenture holds bootcamps, and there's also like the McKinsey Women in Leadership forum and whatnot, yeah.

Amanda: So adding on, it's a really good point that there is a social aspect to it, so you get as much as you put in, so if you’re flaking, you’re not turning up to bonding events, your experience is going to be different, so you just have to be aware that there are time commitments. I do suggest that you do join multiple societies or extracurriculars though, just because each society has their own people and culture, and it’s really different, and you get to see a wider range of how people work by joining more societies. On that note though, I think Viv Wong talked about joining different teams in different societies, I think that’s a really great point, like I don’t want to be joining 5 societies and I’m doing the same work over and over again. I think you should be thinking about what skills you can learn from joining a different team, or the same team but with different responsibilities, so you’re joining a society to develop yourself and like know what skills you want to develop, and I know like a lot of people say I’m in 3 societies, that’s the limit, I don’t want to do too much, but don’t let that scare, I know people who are in like 5 societies, 7 societies, and they’re doing fine, it’s all about how you manage time.

Jane: Yeah thanks, those are all really great insights, I’m sure our listeners will find them all very useful. For our closing question for our podcast let's get a bit nostalgic - what is the one thing you’ll miss most about uni after graduation?

Viv S: Oh my god okay, I know for some of us, graduation isn’t too far off, so I think one thing I’ll really miss is the freedom, I think after university everyone starts getting busy with their own lives, they’ll have their own professions, they might have their own families, what’s more important to note is that their goals and priorities are going to change and that might not necessarily be true all the time, that’s something to keep note of, so I you really want to maintain or pursue a friendship or relationship with someone, you have to make sure you’re actively setting times aside to meet up or talk to them as well, and also I guess in university, you have classes but it's not quite the same as 9-5 work kinda thing, and you don’t have breaks or midsem breaks every semester, you’re kinda working full time the whole year, so it’s definitely kinda important to make sure you are spending time with people, and spending time with the right kind of people you want to surround yourself with in the future as well.

Amanda: The one thing... well the multiple things I’ll miss when I leave uni is probably the road trips, the camps, the airbnb nights, that sort of stuff, just because like, when you're in uni, they’re so much easier to organise, but when you’re out, your friends are going to be dispersed in different career paths and jobs, people might go overseas, it’s just going to be a lot harder to find time when everyone is free, and I really like the flexibility of university schedules, you can choose when you want to do your classes, if you want to turn up to lectures or not, but after graduation most people will have a 9-5.

Nishmi: Yeah I’m still kinda far off from graduation, I’ve still got a few years left but I think the one thing I’ll really miss is, like Viv and Amanda mentioned, the times when you can spend with your friends, and I mean I think a big part of uni is essentially that social life, especially when you’re being surrounded by that many different types of people, and you have so many different opportunities to make friends, and you’re surrounded by so many different events where you can kind of go to with your friends, and I guess once uni finishes, and when we graduate, it just, there’s not as much time or freedom to pursue that, and I mean that’s fair enough, people have their own lives and they have their own commitments professionally and in terms of their own personal life, but I guess seeing everyone go will be pretty sad, but yeah, what can you do.

Jane: thanks for all those insights guys, definitely uni is I feel like the last time where you’re allowed to be free and kinda be a kid, until graduation and suddenly, all your responsibilities are weighing so heavy on you and it’s definitely something I’m sure everyone is going to really miss.
