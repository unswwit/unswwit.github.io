                    <p>Quantium is truly an unprecedented, multifaceted company that offers a plethora of services tailored to a variety of industries, including but not limited to banking and wealth, media, consumer services, health and insurance with a primary function to help clients firms to unlock the infinite potential in their company data. </p>

                    <p>This is achieved through their aim to ‘develop, analyse and monetise datasets, generate insights and embed automatic decision engines’ allowing for effective, strategic data manipulation to assist with and engender well assessed business decisions. As diverse as their company function, so is their workforce - offering a wide variety of career roles such as actuaries, product leaders, data scientists and industry experts - with the booming company, now worth more than $400 million and operating in 5 different countries! </p>

                    <p>However, along with their economic function, Quantium also ensures to ‘give back’ to the extended global community through showing their support. This can be seen through their association with the ‘My Choices Foundation’ which is a non-profit organisation in India that aims to stop domestic violence and sex trafficking.</p>
